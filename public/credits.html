          This website and its layout is entirely handcoded by me. <br>

          It's written on <a href="https://vscodium.com/">VSCodium</a>, tested on Firefox and Chromium browsers. 


<br>
          It is currently hosted on <a href="https://neocities.org/">neocities.org</a> using GitHub and <a href="https://deploy-to-neocities.neocities.org/">deploy-to-neocities</a>. 


        </p>
        <p>
          I extensively
          use resources from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" > w3schools</a>
          and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions" >stackoverflow/questions</a> to learn HTML and CSS. <br>
       
            I sometimes see cool stuff on other sites or boards and copy some code snippets. 
            When I do this, I put <u>credits directly in the code</u>, 
            so if you see something interesting and want to see how I made it just inspect the page and look at the sources in the code comments! <br>
        </p>

      </p>
      More utilities and websites I've used to assist me in the creating of this website can be found in my  
      <a href="/internet/webresources.html">web resources directory</a>.          
    </p>

        <p>
            You can find the script I used to stop the GIFs' animation on <a href="https://github.com/ctrl-freaks/freezeframe.js" >GitHub</a>. <br>
            I used <a href="https://bechnokid.neocities.org/resources/tut_freezeframe" >this tutorial</a> from Bechno Kid to make it work on my site. <br>
        </p>

        <p>The buttons used in the internet reflection page are sourced from <a href="https://suntooth.online/other/gifdump" >suntooth</a>,

          Virtual_Stickers' page uses <a href="https://tholman.com/cursor-effects/" >90's Cursor Effects</a>, 
          a script by <a href="https://tholman.com/" >Tim Holman</a> to set the custom cursor effect.

          The Journal uses <a href="https://status.cafe/" >Status.Cafe</a>'s widget, a microblogging service.
        </p>  

        <p>
          The Blog/Journal was first built with Zonelets, 
          a template/script made by Marina Kittaka. You can find it on <a href="https://zonelets.net/" >Zonelets.net</a>. 
          Some of its code snippets are still present here somewhere.<br>
        </p>

        <p> The custom fonts I use are:  
          [MOZART NBP made by Nate Halley] & 
          [<a href="https://www.dafont.com/autumn-in-november.font">Autumn in November</a>] & 
          [<a href="https://www.dafont.com/graphic-psychopathy.font">Graphic Psychopathy</a>]
        </p>

        <p>
        Dithering effect used on some images obtained thanks to <a href="https://doodad.dev/dither-me-this/">dither me this</a>.
      </p>

        <p>
        Graphics found in tribute pages for my favourite media use pictures owned by third parts. 
        No copyright infringement intended. I just wanted to do something cute.

          And finally: <br>
          every drawing and asset here is made by me, Rrim0, with ❤LOVE❤<br>
