            ðŸŒ±Last Week: Drawing a Tree from Life
        </div>

    <h2>Guidelines: </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Posting can be delayed (bi-weekly or by the end of the month depending on my personal schedule), but the drawing should be completed by the end of the relative week.</li>
            <li>I can complete the challenge in any order I want, but I have to draw ALL the tree types by the end of the challenge.</li>
            <li>Only ONE complete drawing/study a week. Spacing them is important to see any progress.</li>
            <li>The drawings should be studies and as complete as possible with my current skill set.</li>
            <li>No simple rough sketches allowed (or better, allowed as long as it's complementary to a more complete drawing).</li>
            <li>All medium allowed. Graphite, Watercolour, Gouache, Ink... Everything's OK.</li>
            <li>Notes in any language allowed, as long as it's comprehensible to me.</li>
            <li>Have fun!</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Why make it a challenge? </h2>
        <p>
        Trees and flora in general are the most difficult subjects to draw for me personally. <br>
        Problem is: I love the thought of drawing trees and one day becoming able to draw beautiful landscapes full of trees and bushes, 
        but I'm overwelmed by the amount of stuff I need to learn.<br>
        Making it a challenge with myself gives me a loose guideline to follow and a set schedule to pace myself and try to give my best even if my drawing skills are poor.
        </p>

    <h2>
    Why make it public? </h2>
        <p>
        Because why not? Making it public should be an added incentive to make the studies as thoughtful as possible and make me accountable. <br>
        Also, I can come back to them more easily if the studies are available on my website and record my progress (hopefully). It's all very utilitaristic.
        </p>
        <p>
        If the challenge is successful and provide value to me and my learning process I will do other challenges throught 2024, 
        possibly about Flowers and Architecture, but we will see how my artistic goals change!
