    <b> !!! NOTICE: [VERY INCOMPLETE NOTES]</b><br>
    HI! This page will be expanded soonish. <br>
    I'm trying to get more comfortable sharing incomplete pages in order to force myself out of my "perfectionism" mindset. 
    Sorry for the mess!  _(._.)_<br>
    ***********   
    </p>

    
    
    
    <p>
    I curate a companion page where I expose <a href="/internet/index.html">my own experience with the internet</a>. 
    I often come back to it as I delve further into exploring and reflecting how internet has influenced my life and myself as a person. 
    It's a huge mess of contradictions and denial. 
    </p>
    

    <p>(*) I do compare internet consuption and addiction to disordered eating patters. 
        I am not the first one doing this, but I found doing so incredibly fitting and reflecting my own experience. 
    
        I am aware this could potentially disturb some people. Please stay safe. 
    </p>
    <p>
    DISCLAIMER: 
    I am someone who regularly forget their smartphone around (Really. It is a problem.) and doesn't check notifications for days, 
    so unlike a lot of people I am not addicted to my smartphone. 
    However, I do have a problem with regulating internet and media consumption in general. <br>
    This is mostly what I've learned AS AN INTERNET AND DESKTOP HEAVY USER.

    There are a lot of available tools to aid us in our quest of limiting mindless screen time and doom scrolling. 
    This below are the types of software I use or have used and thought were valuable.

    <h3>uBlock Origin</h3>

    <p>
       uBlock Origin is used mostly as an adblocker (and it is the best), 
       but did you know that you can block/hide almost every single element that appears on your browser? 
        </p>
<p>
        You can select elements by picking the eye drop icon (I'm not sure that's the name) and then selecting the element you want to hide. <br>

        <img src="/blog/collection/img/digital_diet/option_ublockorigin.png">    
        <span  style="font-size: 0.8rem; display: inline;">← where to find eye drop and option</p>

        <p>
        To review your filter go to OPTION (the last icon in bottom-right) > MY FILTER.  <br>

        On the newly made filter there will me a gray small comment line looking like this: <br>
        ! 2024-01-01 https://mywebsite.com

        <p>
        
       That line simply state the date you added the filter and the website it's related to and it with not be read as code. 
        You can comment it further adding a ! on the next line below and adding the explaination you need.

        <p>

        For example: I cleaned the interface of neocities's dashboard, the page where I upload this websites's files. 
        Before doing that the interface was very cluttered and I had to scroll down to reach certain folders I wanted to open. 
        After cleaning it up I can look at almost every file/folder I need without scrolling down. </p>

        <div>

            

        Before VS After: (right click for bigger images)<br> 
        
        <img style="max-width: 300px; margin-right:30px ;" src="/blog/collection/img/digital_diet/before block.png">

        Filter: <br>
        <img style="max-width: 300px;" src="/blog/collection/img/digital_diet/filterneocities.png">
        

        

        <p style="font-size: 0.8rem; display: inline;">← the comment written by me says: neocities interface clean up</p>

    </div>
       

<p>You can use this "trick" on almost every website. 
    I use it extensively for any social media platform I peruse like
    reddit, old.reddit, twitter, youtube (you can hide comments! and the recommened side column) , tumblr, etc. 
    and news websites I find too overwelming to look at. But I even use it for smaller websites, duolingo, etc...  <br>
    The limit is your immagination and your own patience. </p> 

<p>
    !!! BEWARE: abusing the blocking filter can potentially break entire websites, 
    so always be prepared for the worst! 
    And if you add a lot of filter lines better properly comment it so you can easily delete what you think is potencially breaking the page. 
</p>

        <p>NOTE: My block filter is 33.000 lines long. 
            Around 23.000 lines come from premade filter lists that I copy-pasted for better ad blocking/privacy benefits, 
            but the rest is all me blocking elements on various page. 
            I have no chill. If something is distracting or annoying me IT HAS TO GO. <br>
            I don't think you have to be on my level (I should probably clean up my filter list a little it), 
            but know that you can block anything you find distracting and have a waaaay better internet experience. 
            This without installing a lot of different add-ons!
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://letsblock.it/">letsblockit</a> has a list of uselful templates for blocking intrusive content you can copy-paste!     
        </p>
        <p>Maybe you are asking yourself  "why should I go through all this potentially website broker hassle?" <br>
            Simple answer: because human beings have a limited mental bandwidth. 
            You can pay attention to only a limited set of information at any single moment and every little distraction, 
            even the smallest seemingly insignificant ones, takes a tool over you cognitive capabilities. </p>
            <p>

            Simply put: too many distractions on a web page = too much cognitive input = cognitive overload = 
            nothing is retained into your working memory (short-term memory) = you are distracted and forget everything you intended to look at!
            </p>
<p>
            Consume only what you need/want to. Block everything else.<br> It doesn't seem much, but it really does make a difference.

    <h3>LeechBlock NG</h3>
    <p>aka my best friend! COMING SOON!</p>









    <h3>RSS Reader</h3>
    
    <p>
    One of the most revolutionary tool I've used to limit time wasting is a RSS reader. <br>
    I often found myself mindless refreshing the feeds of that handful of websites 
    I routinely check on a daily basis (my F5 key got very tired), 
    so limiting my access to the over stimulating native social media feeds was an impellent necessity for me.  
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">
        (( NOTE: I try to access my RSS reader only twice a day, but sometimes I get caught into refreshing it multiple times in the span of only a few hours. 
        ...but the problem is: there is nothing new for days sometimes. WHY BRAIN WHY? ))
        </p>
      
     <p>
    I am personally using Fluent Reader, but it's just because it was the first one I installed and I got used to it. 
    I doubt it's the best one to use. It's pretty barebone and doesn't have a native sync/cloud option, 
    but I personally don't use the feed outside of my desktop environment so that's not a dealbreaker for me. 
  <br>
    You will have to search for the RSS reader that fits your needs the most. 
    </p>

    <p>You will then have to search for the feeds and add them yourself. 
        It will be quite counter-intuitive in the beginning, but once you understand the basics you're good to go. <br>
        Not every website have a RSS feed, 
        but when it's present it's usually advertised with an icon similar to this: 
        <img style="display: inline; max-width: 25px; margin-bottom: -5px;" src="/blog/collection/img/digital_diet/rssfeedicon.webp" alt="RSS icon"><br>
        When you see that, just click on it and copy the url on your feed Reader (ignore how jumbled up the code seems to be. The RSS reader will do the job)!
    </p>
        <p>

            <p>When you can't locate the RSS feed icon, you can try to fetch the feed by adding the following to the end of the websites's URL: 

                [  /rss ; 
                /rss.xml ;  /feed ;
                /feeds ; /atom.xml ;
                .atom  ] <br>( for example: https://disegnomalerrimo.neocities.org<b>/rssfeed.xml</b> (yep, that's my feed. I don't update it that much though lol sorry))
<br>


If there is a feed available a page will load and you can grab that URL!  
<br>
<span style="font-size: 0.9rem;"> (yep, there is also the atom file extension, but I'm not overly familiar to it and my reader doesn't accept it :/ )</span>
<p>
        You can also add feeds from some major social media, news and blogging platforms, 
        but finding the URL is sometimes a little bit difficult. 
        The company usually wants you to go to the native feed because they can then sell you more distractions or advertisement. <br>
        Below a small list of social media feeds I have used with some tips: 
</p>
        
    
   
        <div>
    <p>>>HOW TO FIND THE RSS FEED FOR: </p>
        </div>
    
    <div class="rssnode">
    <h4>REDDIT</h4>
    </div>
    
    <p>
    Reddit has a native RSS feed. <br>
    The wiki says "In most cases, you can create an RSS feed by adding ".rss" to the end of an existing reddit URL". 
    You can find the documentation here: https://www.reddit.com/wiki/rss <br>
    I'm not sure how useful it will be for most users, but I am indeed following one reddit RSS feed at the moment. 
    </p>
    
    <div class="rssnode">
    <h4>YOUTUBE</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
    You can add youtube channels to your RSS feed!!! <br>
    
    This what the native feed URL looks like:

    <div class="codeexample">
    https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id= ***********
    </div>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You will have to search for the channel ID yourself, but you can find it going to:
        <br>
        channel > information > share > copy channel ID (this could slightly differ from YT versions)
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        The channel ID will look something like [ UCLuIidhfu976ifyxClxp7Teg ], so to add the fee to your RSS reader just copy paste the link like this:
        <br>
        https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCLuIidhfu976ifyxClxp7Teg
        <br>  
        The RSS reader will fetch the last 12 videos uploaded to the channel 
        (the ones that appear in the channel under the section "video". they are in chronological order)
    </p>
    
    <p>
     You can set filter to only show a certain type of content from that channel you are interested into (*)! 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Example: I wanted to know when a new Helluva Boss episode was going to be posted by Vivziepop on their channel, 
        but since the channel also posts promotional content for that or their other show and I was not interested at that moment, 
        I tied to figure out how to filter everything else out. 
        <br>
        I notices that almost exclusively the full episodes have the word "episode" on the title, 
        so I set up a filter excluding every video not containing the word "episode". 
    </p>
    
    <p>
         on Fuent Reader the filter looks like this: 
            <div class="codeexample">
                <img src="/blog/collection/img/digital_diet/rss_filter.png" alt="
                Source [Vivziepop]
                If [title] [doesn't match] [episode] 
                then [hide article, mark as read]">          
            <!--
        Source [Vivziepop] <br>
        If [title] [doesn't match] [episode] <br>
        then [hide article, mark as read] -->
           </div>
         <br>
          Result: now only the videos containing the word "episode" are shown on my RSS reader! 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You can customize the filters to fit your needs! 
        It takes a couple of trial and error to get the hang of it, but now I use this trick even for other sources (non YT).
        <br>
        (*)this is not available for every source unfortunately, as it is heavily reliant on what the description/title of the feed item includes. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        CON: the feed reader doesn't filter out YT shorts. 
        My solution was to delete the feed of channels that posts more than one short every couple of weeks and I couldn't block with the filter option. 
        Ain't got no time for that. 
    </p>
    
    <div class="rssnode">
    <h4>
    SUBSTACK </h4>
    </div>
    <p>
        I find subscribing to mailing lists incredibly annoying, but I have found some interesting substacks I'd like to keep tags on. 
        Luckily for me substack has a native RSS feed! You will find the feed like this: 
    
        <div class="codeexample">
    https://[nameofthesubstackyoufollow].substack.com/feed
        </div>

    <br>
    Just add /feed at the end the URL of the page you want to follow. Easy! :D<br>
      
    </p>
  
  
    
    
    
     <div style="text-align: center;">***************</div>
    
    <h3>Screen Time Trackers</h3>
    <p>
    They are useful when you are first trying to get a sense of how much time you are spending on different pages and apps, 
    especially on the smartphone due to how easy it is to use it mindlessly.<br>
    I think that after first assessing your screen time usage and what you want to adjust you are probably better off uninstalling them. 
    Looking at the numbers could easily become an obsession. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    A lot of them are also a privacy minefields. Thread carefully.

    <h3>Ten Arguments<span class="titleislongomg"> For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now</span></h3>
    <div class="author">ーJaron Lanier (2018)</div>
    
    <p>
    Hands down the best book about the issue of social media, both from an individual and societal perspective. 
    <br>  
    Very accessible, easy to read and insightful. Jaron Lanier is one of the best human beings currently talking about this issue. 
    He seems to genuinely care about other people's wellbeing and he's not a "doomer". 
    There is an underlining hope under his writing and reasoning that strangely make this book a "cozy read". 
    </p> 
    
    <p> 
    I also recommend you watch a couple of videos on him talking about this. You can find them of YT.

    <h3>You Should Quit Reddit </h3> 
    <div class="author">ーJacob Desforges (2023)</div>
    <p>
    The most relatable book to my reddit-addicted ass. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    It actually made me sick to the stomach and finally face my problem with that site. 
    While reading there was the realization that DAMN, I TRULY AM A REDDITOR ;_; 
    <br>
    If you have spend a lot of time or reddit (even mostly lurking, like me) this absolutely is the book you need to read. 
    Maybe it will not make you stop using the website, but it will put some stuff in perspective. 
    <br>
    I actually knew a lot of reddit issues before even reading this book, but it was like finally hammering down the nails to the coffin. 
    Thank you, Mr. Jacob Desforges. I am grateful.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This book is probably the most transparent about the struggles of an "internet addict", as it comes from the direct experience of the author. <br>
    While it is mostly centered around reddit, the content applies to any other major social media platform.
    <br>
    Recommended 100%. Brutal.

    <h3>The Shallows:<span class="titleislongomg"> What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains</span></h3>
    <div class="author">ーNicholas Carr (2010)</div>   
        <p>
            A lot of interesting excursus about the history and the sociological change of certain technology during human's history (i.e. clock, typography, etc). <br>
            He doesn't really provide any actionable steps, but there is some serious food of thought here. 
            <br>
            It also made me reflect about the use of hypertext links in posts = links inside a written documents create subconscious distractions 
            (my conclusion: less links = less distractions = maybe better to put all sources at the end of the post?).
            <br>
            Recommended.

        Digital Minimalism: <span class="titleislongomg"> Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World</span></h3>
        <div class="author">ーCal Newport (2019)</div>       
            <p>
                The entry point of everyone aiming to reduce screen time and have a minimalistic (as in decluttered) digital life.
                <br>
                Valuable resource. Highly Recommended.
            </p>
            <p>
                NOTE: While I am grateful to Cal Newport for and for launching the issue of the attention economy and internet distraction into the *mainstream*, 
                I have very mixed feeling about him and some of his argumentations/methods:<br>
                1. he doesn't have direct experience with social media (and it shows) <br>
                2. he regards the issue as almost exclusively an individual one, 
                while I personally  believe it's mostly collective and cultural 
                (this individualistic approach can instill a sense of "shame" 
                into people that are not able to curb their internet/smartphone addiction by themselves)<br>
                3. he is very much into hustle culture <br>
                4. his podcast is ridiculously shallow lol 
            </p>

            <p>
            Even though I have all these (and even more) issues with him, 
            I do believe Digital Minimalism is one of the best books you can read on the issue, 
            especially if you are searching for a guideline on how to do a digital declutter.

    <h3>Stolen Focus:<span class="titleislongomg"> Why You Can't Pay Attention- and How to Think Deeply Again</span></h3>
    <div class="author">ーJohann Hari (2022)</div>  
        <p>
            Johann Hari is a controversial author. He allegedly got caught plagiarizing and altering data in the past 
            (read his wiki under [plagiarism, fabrication and misconduct scandal] to know more), so take everything he says with a grain of salt.
            <br> 
            Still, this book is a very pleasant read and a great introduction to some problems related to the attention economy. 
            Toward the end there is a call to action to society as a whole, which I appreciated.

    <h3>How to Break Up with Your Phone:<span class="titleislongomg"> The 30-Day Plan</span></h3> 
    <div class="author">ーCatherine Price (2018)</div>       
        <p>
            Cute book! The author present a 30 days plans of easily implementable actions to reduce screen-time. 
            Some tips are very useful. The journaling prompts peppered through the whole book are insightful, especially in the ending section.

    <h3>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism:<span class="titleislongomg"> The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power</span></h3>
    <div class="author">ーShoshana Zuboff  (2019)</div>
        <p>
            This book is VERY VERBOSE and data heavy. It took me almost a year to finish it, 
            but it's the best book to understand how the attention economy came to be what it is today. <br>
            It provides context and tries to explain technicalities as easily as possible. 
            I'm not into IT yet even I could understand everything explained in here. <br>
            I found the chapter about how and why Apple got successful (with the rise of iPod) very compelling. 
            My brain was going all "OOOOOOH NOW I SEEEEE" and I appreciate when it happens, ehe. 
        </p>       
        <p>
            Not the easiest of reads, but one of the most engaging books of the list. <br>
            Highly recommended.

    <h3> Freedom to Think:<span class="titleislongomg"> The Long Struggle to Liberate Our Minds</span></h3> 
        <div class="author">ーSusie Alegre (2022)</div></h3>
            <p>
               <b> [CURRENTLY READING - NOT FINISHED]</b> <br>
                The theme is especially relevant to my interests (human civil rights and privacy). 
                So far a great book, if a little verbose. Reminds me of Surveillance Capitalism in its "narration style". 
                She does hate facebook, A LOT. I can relate to that! /high-five

        <p>A message to all Netizens:</p>
    <p>
        Internet feels like a limitless buffet.<br>
        There is both the best most nutritious and delicious food and the worst greasy decadent junk food served right next to each other, 
        everywhere, at all time. 
    </p>   
    <p>
        Finding what the right diet for your body is incredibly complex and requires intentional eating and research. 
        For some people controlling the impulse to binge eat is seemingly an impossible feat, 
        but with compassion, kindness and the right tools maybe we can help them, too.
    </p>    
    <p>
        Let's try our best. Together.
