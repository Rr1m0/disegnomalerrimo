        <h1>JAPANESE LEARNING<br>日本語</h1>

            <p>
                I have studied Japanese for a very long time.  
            </p>

            <p>
                My learning background is this: <br>

                I studied Japanese first at an Italian university, then at a school for foreigners in Japan. 
                I then enrolled in a vocational school with other Japanese teens/young adults and successively worked at a Japanese firm, 
                where everyone spoke Japanese to communicate with each other.  I lived in Japan for a few years. <br>
                While I've always been terribly insecure of my language ability, I was regarded as a high proficiency speaker. 
                I successfully passes JLPT N1 a few years back <span style="font-size: 0.9rem;"> (for some people that's an important metric. 
                I have mixed feelings on this because passing the test does't mean much apart from the fact that you know how to study TO PASS the JLPT. 
                It's a certification useful for job hunting/scholarships, not a real "Japanese proficiency assessment").  </span>
            </p>

            <p>
                My output, both oral and written, was way better in Japanese than English until recently. I left Japan back in 2021 and, while I'm still consuming media in Japanese and communicate with my friends in Japan on a semi-regular basis, my language proficiency certainly suffered. <br>
                I reckon my grammar is way better in Japanese than English. I never really "studied" English, but Japanese? OH BOY, DID I STUDY IT. <br>
                (Funny thing: I often search English terms going to <a href="https://jisho.org/">jisho.org</a>  and writing the Japanese translation. 
                There are a lot of words that I understand when I read them in English, but I can only recall in Japanese! Brains are strange)
                </p>

            <p>
                I have a tiny bit of background in teaching both Japanese and English (LMAO I KNOW RIGHT)
                and language pedagogy is one of my interests (mostly of Italian, though). 
            </p>

            <p>
                Japanese is my passion. And I'd love for other people to be as passionate as me about this beautiful language and to have a good experience while learning it. <br> 
                These below are my advices to other students. 
            </p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                From a long time Japanese learner, with love. ♥
            </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>First of all: 
        KNOW THYSELF </h2>

            <p>
                Everyone is different and everyone has a different approach to learning. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I, for example, am a very visual learner. I can listen to someone repeating words for hours, 
                but if I don't see them written or I don't write them myself then they don't enter my working memory. They just go *puff*!
            </p>

            <p>
                Other people have an enhanced auditory memory and can remember a lot of information and vocabulary they have heard only a couple of times. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The scientific consensus seem to indicate that best approach overall is:<br>
                a mix of auditory and visual input! TA-DA!
            </p>

            <p>
                So, mix it up! If you learn more visually, lean more on that. If you find it more motivating to listen to music or podcast the go ahead. 
                The important thing is knowing what works best for you and you will know that with experience. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Remember that learning a new language, especially if it's you first foreign language, is an endless succession of failures, corrections and repetitions. <br>
                To get better at your target language and language learning in general, 
                you need to shed your ego and admit that you will suck for a long time before getting better.  <br>
                The more you fail, get corrected and repeat, the more confidence and proficiency you will gain! It's actually part of the fun! Like in videogames! 

            </p>

   <hr>



    <h2>SET YOUR GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS </h2>

        <p>
            This is very important yet underestimated: set your OWN goal and you OWN expectations. <br>
            Often people claim they want to become "FLUENT" in their target language, but what does fluency even mean? <br>
            It's too nebulous to really measure and thus it's quite useless to set that as a long-term goal. You will never know when you are fluent enough! That's quite demotivating. 
        </p>

        <p>
            So, ask yourself this, instead: 
            <ul>
                <li>WHY DO I WANT TO LEARN JAPANESE? </li>
                <li>WHAT IS MY GOAL? </li>
                    <li>Do I want to SPEAK, WRITE, LISTEN or READ? Everything?  </li>
                <li>Do I simply want to be able to read manga and watch anime (passive) 
                    or do I want to work with Japanese people or move and live in Japan one day (active)? </li>
                <li>Do I have a specific interest that require a very specific set of language skills 
                (i.e. medical field, military, engineering, etc.) or do I simply want to understand basic conversational Japanese? </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            Your approach will change based on your goals, especially past the very first beginner phase. 
        </p>

        <p>
            NOTE: GOALS CHANGE!!! Keep an open mind and change your approach as you see fit. 
        </p>

        <p>
            For example: I first started learning Japanese because I was into Anime and Manga, 
            but then I completely lost interest in those (almost as soon as I entered university actually, lol) 
            and I got engrossed in Japanese religion and history! And then I got into literature, and then tourism and then... [insert forever ongoing list]. <br>
            At first for me it seemed enough to just know basic Japanese, 
            but then to properly research my newfound interests I had to change resources and strive for a more specific set of skills. 
            I was enrolled in university, so I was both forced to learn and actively encouraged to find my own niche, 
            but I continued to develop new interests even after graduating. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Another example: I've been studying Russian as hobby and by myself on and off since high school. 
            I have no plan to actively use Russian in my daily live. I just want to understand enough of the language 
            to be able to listen to my favourite indie rock musicians and sing (badly) along.<br> 
            My approach to learning Russian is drastically different from the one I took with Japanese. 
            Perfect Cyrillic handwriting? Who cares. Perfect Russian pronunciation or grammar? LOL whatever!
        </p>

            You don't need to be perfect if you don't want to. Language is a tool to reach other goals. 
        </p>

<h2>JAPANESE PRONUNCIATION ・ 発音</h2>


<p>
I can't really pronounce (ehe) myself on this. <br>
Being native Italian fortunately means that I had less difficulties grasping Japanese pronunciation, 
compared to English only speakers (we do have our own difficulties to overcome with Japanese pronunciation. 
If you are Italian and interested in this topic you can ask me!).
</p>

<p>
I hear (uhu) that Dogen is a good teacher and he is specialized in Japanese phonetics for Anglophones. 
I sometimes follow him for his funny sketches and I have to say that his pronunciation is flawless, 
so check him out if you're completely lost. (he does talk like an edokko [Tokyoite], which I am certainly NOT. KANSAI FOREVAAAH たこ焼きすっきゃねんw) 
</p>


<hr>

<h2>KANJI ・ 漢字</h2>


<p>
Kanji are AMAZING. People telling you that Japanese sucks to learn because of Kanji? THEY ARE WRONG! Kanji is the best thing about Japanese (for me)!<br>
The problem with Kanji is that there is a lot of them at they can be very intimidating, 
especially at the beginning when you read that "you have to learn all 2000 characters to know Japanese!!!" (spoilers: you don't). 
But rest assured: the more you study them and practice them, the more comfortable you'll become and the more interesting they will in turn become! 
</p>

<p>
Retaining all that info in your memory will be difficult. Unfortunately this is the curse of the beautiful gift kanji are. 
You will have to practice them for as long as you want to retain your knowledge in Japanese, 
but if you simply want to understand Japanese and not actively write it, then you will have an easier time. <br>
It's not mandatory to know the correct pronunciation of each compound word (熟語・じゅくご) or the correct writing order of the more advanced characters.<br>
I do believe it's valuable, though.  
</p>



<p>
MY ADVICE IS THIS: Study Kanji as hard as you can in the beginning. Build solid bases. 
Repeat and drill those first kanji (500～800) as long as you can. 
You will then have an easier time when encountering more complex kanji, since you will intuitively understand their semantic family (and  meaning!) and even their pronunciation.  
</p>

<p>
    Do NOT learn ALL the KUN'yomi and ON'yomi of EVERY kanji. 
    Try doing it for your first 100～150 kanji since they are the most commonly used and often have a lot of different pronunciations 
    (also look at the radicals and for common patters!), but then try learning kanji's pronunciation within their meaning and context. 
    Once you get them they will become second nature to you. 
    </p>

<p>
Honestly, kanji is both the best and worst thing about Japanese, but if you fell in love with them you're going to have a great time! 
</p>

漢字最高漢字万歳

(signed, a kanji otaku with poor memory. I do at least 5 minutes of kanji exercise every day and I still keep forgetting them lol) 
</p>

<h2>JAPANESE GRAMMAR (Oh, boy. This is hard.) </h2>

<p>
If you can, try learning grammar the Japanese way!!!<br>
I notices that some English resources have their own way of explaining Japanese grammar and UHM I do think it complicates things considerevoly. 
Like. I, an "advanced" speaker, don't really get those. 
</p>

<p>NOTE: I need to do more researches on this. Maybe it's the native Italian in me that's advanced in learning grammar "the Japanese way", 
    but I noticed a difference between people who took the Japanese approach and who didn't in how easily they could jump to an intermediate level. <br>
    If you are already intermediate or have figure it all on your own, then by all mean proceed doing what you're doing! 
    As long as you're learning you're doing fine! :)
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">*********</div>
<p>
This is the very essential skeleton of Japanese grammar: 
</p>

<p>
ADJECTIVES <br>
形容詞 けいようし keiyoushi: adjectives <br>
final in ～い　寒<b>い</b>　さむ<b>い</b>　寒<b>く</b>なる cold <br>
final in ～な　静か<b>な</b>　しずか<b>な</b>　静か<b>に</b>なる quiet 
</p>

<p>
VERBS<br>
<b>他</b>動詞 たどうし tadoushi = transitive verb (uses <b>を</b>) subject + verb + object <br>
<b>自</b>動詞 じどうし jidoushi = intransitive verb (uses <b>が</b>) subject + verb (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">NO OBJECT</span>) 
</p>

<p>
example:<br>

(私は) 火 <b>を</b> 消<b>す</b> vs 火 <b>が</b> 消<b>える</b> <br>

I estinguish the fire vs the fire is estinguised 
</p>

<p>
When I was studying Japanese in university, these were some of the first things they teached us.
</p>

<p>
Once you know these categories and the conjugation tables you're set to go. 
You just need to memorize what type of adjective/verb a certain word is and with enough pratice it will become second nature. 
You will hear something and immediately understand in which category it falls into.  <br>
Unlike a lot of other languages, Japanese is very regular with the conjugations for its adjective and verbs. A true blessing! 
</p>

<p>
(*I do think I will expand of this in the future, make all the tables and everything, explain verbs a little more and give more examples. 
Please be patient while I work on this. ^^)

<h2>KEIGO ・ 敬語</h2> 

<p>
Keigo is difficult to understand in the beginning, but understanding it is the hardest part.
</p>

<p>
Due to cultural differences, getting why keigo is important and how it does function is one of the biggest hurdle for students. <br>
This is true especially for English only speakers, 
since they have no commonly used formal register when speaking with other people. 
Once you get the logic of it, though, it's not so complicated. You just have to memorize alternative forms of the most used verbs/words. <br>
Don't get discouraged!
</p>

<p>
This is a very basic explanation: 
</p>

<p>
<b>尊敬語</b> そんけいご　sonkeigo :<br> 
formal Japanese directed at OTHER people (ie. いらっしゃる YOU come/go/be,  おっしゃる YOU say)  <br>
*いらっしゃいませ IRASSHAIMASE, meaning WELCOME is a form or sonkeigo! You surely often hear this!
</p>

<p>
<b>謙譲語</b> けんじょうご　kenjougo : <br> 
formal Japanese directed at YOURSELF (ie. 伺う I ask, 申し上げる I say) <br>
*ございます gozaimasu, is the kenjougo form of I AM, desu
</p>

<p>
<b>丁寧語</b> ていねいご　teineigo 「です・～ます」 : <br>
standard polite Japanese. You will speak this 99% of time.
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">*********</div> 
<p>Very simple table with the verb 言う (say): 

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>BASE</th>
          <th>丁寧語</th>
          <th>尊敬語</th>
          <th>丁寧語</th>
        </tr>
        <tr style="text-align: center;">
            <td>言う</td>
          <td>言います</td>
          <td>おっしゃる</td>
          <td>申し上げます</td>
        </tr>

        <tr style="text-align: center;">
            <td>to say <br>(anyone)</td>
          <td>I/you/she/he say(s) <br> (anyone)</td>
          <td> you/he/she/they say(s) <br>(second/third person)</td>
          <td>I say<br> (first person ONLY)</td>
        </tr>
      
      </table>
<BR>

<h2>LANGUAGE INPUT RANKED *!!!IN MY EXPERIENCE!!! </h2>


<p>
As I already stated, this vastly varies from person to person, but I found that FOR ME personally there is a certain hierarchy of usefulness of input.<br>
This is based mostly of easiness of understanding, the register of the language used and on what frequency the vocabulary used appears in standard spoken Japanese. Highly unscientific biased method of ranking, lol. <br>
This is a highly controversial topic, I believe, so please keep in mind: this is NOT a list of "the true best way to learn Japanese EVAH". I'm just sharing my experience!
<br>


The list goes from best to worst. 
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">*********</div>
<p>
for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ORAL</span> input:<br>

<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> ☆youtube > dorama/movies > songs (lyrics) > anime </span>
</p>

<p>
BEST= <br>
<b>Youtube</b>: especially v-logs are excellent as a pronunciation and vocabulary input. You can listen to the unadulterated natural way normal ordinary people speak.
(CON: you have to find decent channels; not all channels have good quality Japanese or content) <br>
I do think podcasts are similar. I don't personally listen to them, though. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dorama/Movies</b>: scripted, but usually natural spoken language. Very good to learn cultural customs, hear different accent and registers. Especially good for Keigo and every day language. 
Japanese shows usually have a more "grounded" feeling to their production compared to North American shows. They feel more real and natural. <br>
Now with Netflix and other streaming platform, Japanese shows are more available than ever! Go watch movies/dorama of the genre you like the most! :D
</p>

<p>
<b>Lyrics</b>:
totally biased entry here. 
I am a sucker for music and learning lyrics in general, and Japanese music is so varied and interesting! 
I'm not sure, but I think I learned A TON of vocabulary thanks to music. Possibly the majority of the vocabulary 
I acquired as a beginner student comes from Anime OPs and enka songs.  <br>
My method was simple yet effective: I listened to a song, searched the lyrics, wrote down the vocabulary I didn't know and then REPEATED THE SONG FOREVAH until I learned to sing it. 
Karaoke is your friend. <br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"> -the enemy of your neighbors' ears is the friend of your learning brain</span> (ancient wisdom) 
</p>

<p>
WORST=<br> <b> Anime</b> : 
I ASK FOR FORGIVENESS! <br>
Anime shows are very entertaining and I urge you to watch them if you enjoy them, but unfortunately I think it's the most difficult way to get good Japanese oral input.<br>
This varies from genres and titles, of course, but generally the language is often forced or not natural at all. 
</p>

<p>
BUT!!! Good input to get used to pronunciation and to have fun! 
and I repeat: if you like anime and will not consume anything else I listed above, WATCH A LOT OF ANIME! 
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">*********</div>
<p>
for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">WRITTEN</span> input <br><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">

☆blogs (websites/SNS) > visual novels > books >  fanfiction  >  manga  </span>

<p>
BEST=<br>
<b>Blogs</b>: clean, polite, grammatically correct Japanese most of the time. Concise and related to an ample array of different topics 
(BIG CON: you have to find good blogs)
</p>

<p>
<b>Visual Novels</b>: Both spoken and narrated language! You can replay and reread stuff you don't understand at first. Best visual novels for beginners are the ones with voices and probably modern setting dating sims (...I began playing a lot of  otome games to learn Japanese. I am not their target demographic, but I fell in love with the trash.) 
</p>


<p>
<b>Books</b>: Beginners books are difficult because they have too much hiragana, advanced books are too difficult because of too much kanji :((( difficult to find balance, especially in the beginning. Non-fiction books are easier to read! <br>
If you can, read Japanese tranlations of your favourite books! 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fanfiction</b>: I'm totally biased here, no shame. I find fanfiction to be EXCELLENT Japanese exercise. 
They retain your interest more because EH it's fanfiction, you like those characters! 
And you are already familiar with the setting, characters and their manner of speaking so you can intuitively understand better than with books 
(same with doujinshi, but they fall into the manga category). Problem is: not every fanfiction is GOOD fanfiction. Japanese is usually correct, though.
</p>

<p>
WORST=<br> 
<b>Manga</b>: I'M SO SORRY LOL <br>
manga are some of the worst language inputs for me ;__; the reason is simple: manga language is waaaay over exaggerated, 
uses tropes and language that are very "dirty" and there is no prose nor narration, so it's spoken Japanese without the pronunciation input benefit. 
This obviously varies a lot, but people usually don't speak the Japanese you find in manga.
</p>

<p>
BUT!!! SUPER BUT!!!<br>
MANGA IS GREAT FOR KANJI!!!<br>
Depending on what you're reading, manga will often have furigana attached to almost every kanji present on paper. 
This is great especially for a beginner, when you are still not that used to kanji and need to do kana reading exercise. <br>
Manga are valuable to advanced learners, too. Some action manga use CRAZY kanji and ateji!<br>
You can have fun with your favourite stories and learn a a lot of vocabulary!

<h2>BEWARE OF OVER RELIANCE ON ANKI as a learning tool</h2>

<p>
I do personally believe that Anki is a REVISION tool, not a studying resource. 
</p>

<p>
The most effective way to use Anki for me is: <br>

study vocabulary in context (through book, video, game) > write it and repeat it a few times > try to fully understand the meaning of the word (ex. putting it in other context) > write the Anki card > revision through Anki 
</p>

<p>
Using pre-made Anki collections is a recipe for disaster if you are not careful. <br>
I say this because I tried it with Russian (and Esperanto) and NOPE. WHAT??? Too overwhelming. <br>
I looked at some pre-made decks available on ankiweb and I have to say that the Japanese ones are possibly the best there, 
but I'm still not convince of their usefulness, especially for beginners.<br>
Thread with caution.  
</p>

<p>
NOTE: I do use Anki almost everyday for kanji and vocabulary revision. 
I even donate to Anki on a yearly basis, since I've been using it for 10+ years now. 
So I'm not against Anki per se, but I think that in certain language learning circles Anki is heralded as the best studying tool ever while 
I believe it should be regarded as a supplementary tool.
</p>

<p>
Of course if you only have time or energy for Anki, do that!
It's better than nothing. <br> Beware though, because you risk burn out if you tackle too many cards.    
</p>

<p>
NOTE: you can also do your own physical cards! I have a collection of old card decks and I'm currently building my second one for Russian. You can make them cute and put inside silly drawings or strange colours, too. <br>
Anki is an excellent software, but customizing the cards is a hassle sometimes. 
With physical pieces of papers decoration and editing is faster. And writing with pen or pencil is good exercise!

<h2>RANDOM NOTES: </h2>

<p>
    - Learn more about memory retention and short term memory (aka working memory) and long term memory. 
    It will be useful! And not only for language learning.
    </p>

<p>
- Change your setting in Japanese as soon as you can (past beginner level)! It's going to be annoying, 
but you'll get used to it faster than you'd believe. <br>
If you are in difficulty, just reverse back searching for: 設定 > 言語 > 英語
</p>



<p>
- At first you'll be forced to use resources in your own language to learn the basic, 
but I suggest you strive to integrate monolingual (Japanese only) resources to your toolkit as soon as possible! <br>
Don't entirely ditch bilingual resources (it will take you a lot on time before being about to do that and I think it is not required), 
but use as many monolingual resources as you can. <br>
Searching for language tips on google or other search engines is way easier in Japanese than it is for English. Less AI. Less bullshit. 
</p>

<p>
    - ATEJI (当て字) are evil LOL but also very interesting, both culturally and linguistically!
     Keep an open eye and remember that even Japanese people don't know every ateji ever. <br>
    I'm particularly bad at them, but some of my Japanese classmates were not that better either... 
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
    - PERSONALLY mnemonically the most difficult thing are: onomatopoeias. JESUS. TOO MANY! 
    You will possibly have an easier time if you read a lot of manga, but honestly IDK. 
    </p>

<p>
- If your aim is do gain a job in Japan (speaking Japanese): <br>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>
NOT REQUIRED BUT A HUGE BOOST FOR YOUR EMPLOYABILITY = <br>
・If your native language includes Chinese characters (i.e. Mandarin) strive for : JLPT N1 <br>
・If your native language doesn't include Chinese characters (i.e. English) strive for: JLPT N2 
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
for absolutely everyone: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> STUDY AND MASTER KEIGO!</span> <br>

In a working environment nobody really cares if you know every vocabulary ever or if you mastered all the 2000 kanji, 
but everybody cares about POLITENESS. <br>
YOU NEED TO KNOW YOUR KEIGO. It will make a huge difference, trust me. <br>
This is the only thing I'm sure of 100%.

    <h2>
        most important of all: 
        HAVE FUN LEARNING!!!
    </h2>


        <p>
            Do little comics, write all your website in Japanese, keep a log with your favourite anime/manga phases or lyrics (I know I do), 
            play games, code a little learning exercise (maybe I will!)!  <br>
            Watch your favourite anime first with English subs then with Japanese subs then maybe no subs at all! Write haiku! Practice traditional calligraphy! <br>
            Challenge yourself!
        </p>

        <p>
            This will be a long journey and you should have fun along the ride! <br>
