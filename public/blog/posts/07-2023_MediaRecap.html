      <p>
        So, the year 2023 has ended and a shiny brand new 2024 is upon us, yeah? <br>
        What better time to make a list of the media I enjoyed (or despised) during the course of last year!
      </p>
<p>
I've had the habit of listing every piece of media I partake in in my bullet journal since 2021 and, at the end of each year,
I quite enjoy reflecting on what TV series to continue, what to drop, what games I enjoyed and whatnot.<br> 
I find it really useful to revisit my “media consumption” and I enjoy reading other people's recap, too, so this is mine! (っ˘ω˘ς )
</p>
<p>
Disclaimer: this is not a list of the objectively best media out there, 
but the ones I personally enjoyed the most and/or particularly surprised me this year. 
</p>
<p>
Notes: 
<ul>
<li>I didn't play many games this year and I only completed two! </li>
<li>No new manga/comic. I read quite a lot of western comics and a few long Japanese manga series last year so I'm probably still digesting those.</li>
<li>This year I did not consume any media for three months (June-July-August) apart for some non-fiction books and music. Wow. </li>
<li>First year reading more non-fiction books than fiction books. Strange.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Best Movie</h2>

<h3 class="winner">Pig (2021)</h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(2021_film)">
<img src="/blog/posts/img/07MediaRecap/Pig.jpg" class="imgleft" width="150"></a>

<p>
This movie takes your heart and stomp all over it over and over again. I loved that. 
There is a sense of underlining desperation and alienation of the human condition throughout the whole movie, but there is also hope and empathy. <br><br>
It's a movie that made me feel less alone, but most of all it's a movie that MADE ME FEEL FIERCELY. 
Possibly Nicolas's Cage best performance (but he's doing so well lately). <br>
Highly recommended to anyone who enjoy introspective movies.
</p>


<h2>
Best Horror Movies</h2>

<h3 class="winner">The Void (2017) </h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Void_(2016_film)">
  <img src="/blog/posts/img/07MediaRecap/TheVoid.png" class="imgright" width="150"></a>
<p>
Is this movie very derivative, confusing and without incredible character development? Sure!
Did I enjoy every single second of it? DAMN YES I DID. <br> I LOVED IT. INJECT IT STRAIGHT INTO MY VEINS! <br>
It has almost everything I enjoy in a horror movie: gore, mind-fuckery, cosmic existential horror, random cultist shenanigans and good practical effects. What is there not to love? <br><br>

Watch it if you like 80s style horror and want to have some “light” fun.
This movie goes straight to my “re-watching this ad infinitum” list.<br><br>

Bonus Point: only 90 minutes long HELL YEAH
</p>

<h3 class="winner"> Evil Dead Rise (2023) </h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_Dead_Rise">
  <img src="/blog/posts/img/07MediaRecap/EvilDeadRise.jpg" class="imgleft" width="130"></a>

<p>
I can't believe how much I loved this movie. This was the title I was the most hyped for in 2023 and it delivered EVERYTHING. <br>
The gore? Amazing. YUMMY! The tension? HIGH. The characters? I don't know about you, but I like them! And it has one of my most liked horror scenes in recent memory:

<details>
<summary>WARNING: LIGHT SPOILER! >click to reveal </summary>
 
The peephole scene is the best thing I've seen this year. AAAAH
</details>
<br><br>

I've very excited for Evil Dead's future. So far the only horror franchise, alongside Child's Play/Chucky, that delivered at every single entry. 
<br>The 2013's reboot is still one of my favourite remake ever. You can feel the passion they put in that movie and this one. <br>Good job 10/10 A+!
</p>


<h3>Honorary Mentions: </h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Mandy</b> (2018): Damn, what a movie. Go in completely blind like I did. It's a real trip.
    Nicolas Cage sure is convincing in this role. Utter lunacy. Incredible scenes and colours. </li>
  <li><b>Barbarian</b> (2022): If you still have to watch it, go into it blind, don't read/watch anything about it. 
    I didn't know anything and it was incredibly fun!</li>
<li><b>The Empty Man</b> (2020): quite long, but very intriguing.</li>
<li><b>American Mary</b> (2012): A movie that ends with a dedication to Eli Roth. I can see why. Lots of triggers in this one. Proceed with caution.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>
Good re-watches of the year:</h3>
<p>
<b>Pandorum</b> (trashy horror sci-fi that I absolutely adore), 
  <b>Descent</b> (two times!), 
    <b>Malignant</b> (the one single best horror movie of the last 5 years), 
      <b>Re-animator</b> (I always forget how much I love Herbert West, what a lovable little loser), 
        <b>The Ritual</b>, 
          <b>Event Horizon</b> (but I watch this every single year), 
            <b>Sinister</b>.</p>


<h2>
Best TV Show</h2>

<h3 class="winner">Oz (1997~2003)</h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oz_(TV_series)">
  <img src="/blog/posts/img/07MediaRecap/oz.jpeg" class="imgright" width="160"></a>

<p>
The first season is possibly one of the best thing I've ever seen in my entire life. <br>
But I honestly have no idea if that's because the writing is good or because I've been invested in the characters 
and their respective storylines right by episode 1. 
<br><br>
I started watching Oz because I was in the middle of yet another Law & Order: SVU marathon 
and was idly searching info about the actors on Wikipedia, when I discovered that Christopher Meloni played a <i>bisexual serial killer</i> 
on an old show about a prison I never heard about. My curiosity was instantly piqued and thus my binge-watching of Oz began in March 2023! 
<br><br>
Oz is a strange TV show by today's standards. I don't think it's actually THAT good, but oh god, it had everything I ever wanted from a prison drama 
(Yep, I was a fan of Orange is the New Black back in the day).<br>
It's cruel, crude, strangely funny, absurd, campy, uneasy and very politically charged. <br> 
Some of the characters are so charismatic and iconic I don't think I will ever forget about them.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, as it usually happens to long running TV show, by mid-season 3 (out of 5), the writing quality decline significatly and some character arcs then continue to repeat themselves.
But the first 2 seasons? GOOD. SO GOOD. <br><br>

My absolutely favourite character out of Oz and of 2023 as a whole is: <b>Kareem Saïd</b>. 
A muslim inmate of Oz whose character arc is basically the internal struggle between his faith in Allah and his own big ego. 
Absolutely incredible character and amazing performance by the actor Eamonn Walker.<br><br>
Chris Keller, the bisexual serial killer played by Christopher Meloni, 
 was second best character because he was just pure chaotic evil/neutral energy with a lot of narcissistic psychotic fuel to it.

<details>
  <summary>MAJOR SPOILERS FOR OZ >click to reveal</summary>
  CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHY IS SAïD'S DEATH THE WORST ONE??? JESUS CHRIST WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!! <br>
  Exploring how Saïd transitioned from his previous "nihilistic" preachy self to the Saïd we've know during the show could've been one of the most interesting character arc of the show, but NO, 
  the showrunners had him killed by a random guy who had an existential crisis because years prior Saïd told him that God didn't exists??? WHAT??? <br>
  One of the most infurianting death of a fictional character I've ever witnessed.<br><br>
  
  Chris Keller mai boi had a very nice conclusion. Such a fucked up character from start to finish. I just had to clap my hands at his final scene. What a drama king! <br>
   GOOD BOI. Beecher didn't deserve you (or did he?).   
</details>
</p>

<p>
I think this is a TV show that I will revisit somewhat soon. I will possibly write more about it on this site because I think it deserves more of my attention and love.
Some themes were incredibly compelling and worth further consideration. <br>
OH AND I BOUGHT THE OFFICIAL BOOK! 
</p>
   
<h3>Honorary Mentions: </h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Under the Banner of Heaven</b> (2022) : 
    I didn't know this was True Crime when I first started it (I usually don't watch true crime), so I approached it as fiction. I enjoyed the internal struggle of the protagonist, the scenery and how "quiet" it was. </li>
<li><b>Quartet</b> (2017) : quirky Japanese dorama with a little bit of mistery and some really funny scenes. Not one of the best dorama out there, but one of the best I've watched in recent years. All performances are stellar. </li>
</ul>

<!--///////////////////-->
<h2>
Best Anime/Cartoon</h2>
<h3 class="winner"> Miraculous Ladybug (2015~) </h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miraculous%3A_Tales_of_Ladybug_%26_Cat_Noir">
  <img src="/blog/posts/img/07MediaRecap/miraculous.jpeg" class="imgleft" width="170"></a>

YES. This cartoon is a mess. YES. The animation style is not the best. YES. I still absolutely love it. 
<br><br>
I actually started watching Miraculous in 2016 I think, but then life got in the way and I forgot to follow it for years. <br>
This year though I remembered it so I binge-watched it from season 3 to 5 and GOD. What a mess. I love it. <br>
I love how inclusive it is, even if at times it's very awkward with it. My inner child screams with joy and weep with resentment about that. 
Damn, I wish I has a cartoon like this when I was a kid... I hope today's kids are enjoying it as much as I am.
<br><br>
Note: I only watch Miraculous with the Italian dub because EHM I don't really like French… I'm sorry, French speaking folks. The Italian dub is pretty solid! One of the best in recent years!

<h2>Best Book</h2>
<h3 class="winner">Heaven by Mieko Kawakami (2009)</h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_(Kawakami_novel)">
  <img src="/blog/posts/img/07MediaRecap/Heaven.jpg" class="imgleft" width="130"></a>


<p>
What a punch in the gut. <br>A book about alienation and bullyism and what it does to people. <br>
If everyone around you refuse to look at you as a human being with basic dignity, what would you do? <br> 
Do you resign yourself? Do you cry and wallow in self pity? 
Do you strip away all the vulnerability and embrace the status of “other” just in order to survive? Do you taunt your bullies further just to confirm you deserve the hate? Do you respond?
<br>These are some of the question I found in this book.<br>
A very cruel, beautifully written story form the point of view of a bullied Japanese teenager. 
<br>
The Italian translation by Gianluca Coci was pretty good, too.  
</p>
<h3>Honorary Mention: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>
<b>Concerning my Daughter</b> by Kim Hye-Jin (2017) : A novella about a South Korean mother struggling to accept her daughter's homosexuality. Brutal. Very human.</li>
</ul>


<!--////////////////-->

<h2>Best Game</h2>
<h3 class="winner">Fire Emblem: Vision quest </h3>
<a href="https://feuniverse.us/t/fe8-complete-fire-emblem-vision-quest-v3-by-pushwall-1-oct-22/3815">
  <img src="/blog/posts/img/07MediaRecap/VisionQuest.jpg" class="imgright" width="140"></a>

  <p>
    A Fire Emblem romhack/fangame made by Pandan and friends. <br>
    I love all the GBA Fire Emblem games and this is a great unofficial addition to the franchise. 
    The story is pretty compelling, the characters likeable and the maps are so much fun! Possibly some of the best FE maps I've ever played! <br><br>
    This is a true labour of love and one of the reasons I think internet is amazing. The modding community needs to be preserved, praised and encouraged more than ever. 
    You can find the hack by clicking on the picture. <br>
  
Playtime: around 30-40 hours. I played it in the span of a whole month and didn't get tired of it. 
  </p>

<h3>Honorary Mention: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>
<b>Paranormasight</b> (2023) : the only other game I completed this year, lol. Cute horror visual novel! The characters are incredibly charismatic and I loved how they used the urban legends.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Best New Music Discovered</h2>

<h3 class="winner">Käärijä</h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4%C3%A4rij%C3%A4 ">
  <img src="/blog/posts/img/07MediaRecap/kaarija.jpeg" class="imgleft" width="130"></a>
<p>
Thank you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6rS8Dv5g-8">Eurovision</a> for this gift that keeps on giving. <br>
This guy from Finland was the biggest surprise of the year for me and the fan-favourite of ESC 2023. 
I love his music style (is that pop + rap + metal + dance??? YES PLEASE!) and I didn't know I needed something like that in my life. 
Fantastista is an awesome album and I can't wait for the next one. <br><br>

This is what Eurovision is all about: discovering new artists who push you to discover new genres and sounds. Shame he didn't win this ESC edition, but he surely won my heart and ears.

<h2>Biggest Disappointments of 2023:</h2>

<h3 class="winner">Saw X (2023) </h3>
<p>
I just wanted some good gore... what the hell happened there? <br>
I could write a 5.000 words post about how much I disliked this movie. It was just… wrong. <br>
In my opinion an insult to longtime fans of the saga. And I say this as someone who has followed Saw since the first movie (yep. since 2004!) 
and enjoyed every single installment. YES, I even enjoyed Spiral because I have no standard with gore movies/torture porn flicks. 
BUT I HATED SAW X. Worst story and, even worse, worst traps of all the franchise. BLEH <br><br>
The worst part in all this is that the film is being acclaimed by critics and other horror fans online. <br> 
What the hell is wrong with you people?! Or what the hell is wrong with me??? <br>
To highlight how I felt about this movie: I wrote a total of 5 tweets this year and one of those tweet is “nothing convinced me more of people's utter lack of taste than all these people praising Saw X. What a shite film.” I stand by that.
</p>

<h3 class="winner">Black Mirror Season 6 (2023)</h3>
<p>
Good Lord. WHY. <br>
Incredibly awful as a Black Mirror season and laughable as a horror movie anthology (which it is at this point, let's be real). <br>
I do understand why they market these short movies as “Black Mirror”, but it's so divorced from the original tone and values it's alienating. 
I've been a fan of Black Mirror since 2013 and at this point I can say that the last good Black Mirror episode was in 2016. 
<br>
Complete waste of potential here. I will not watch the next seasons. 
</p>

<h3 class="winner">Vanilla Sky (2001)</h3>
<p>
I watched this movie during a “movie night” with my sister and OMG why. I think I spent the whole night just commenting how stupid and utterly grating this movie and all the characters were (I'm sorry, sis). I hated it. <br>
I just don't like “romance” movies and this one in particular was vapid and unconvincing. And the plot twist? What a joke. <br>It doesn't help that I really dislike Tom Cruise as an actor. <br>Oh, and it's 2h17m long. AND IT'S A REMAKE OF A SPANISH MOVIE. I feel so conned.<br> I still taunt my sister parroting some scenes to her, since she was the one that choose it and she has to pay for her grave mistake. <br>
The only redeeming thing about this movie was the colour palette. I remember some pretty good looking scenes. 
</p>






<h3> Mild disappointments: </h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Shadow & Bone season 2</b> : I'm not surprised it was cancelled. I love all the cast, but mixing the Six of Crows with Alina's story did not pay out.</li>
<li><b>Scream VI</b> (2023) : just meh</li>
<li><b>Luther</b> (2023) : UHM... Why the hell did they make this movie? I was kind of hyped for it, but it ended up being very stupid. Sigh.</li>

</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Final Considerations: </h2>
<ul>
  <li>I am the happiest when I just watch horror movies, read a few books/fanfiction and consume little else. </li>
  <li>The more I got into drawing (since May) and coding (since September) the less media I consumed. I don't even watch youtube videos that much anymore. </li>
  <li>I've been playing less and less games the older I become, but I think my sweet spot is two to three medium length story driven single player games a year + occasional strategic or rougue-like games. </li>
  <li>Next year I want to watch even less TV shows bacause I really don't enjoy them as much anymore. I prefer movies or very short limited series.</li>

</ul>

<p><br>And that's it! Writing this post has been incredibly fun. I hope 2024 will be a year full of best hits and devoid of disappointments. We will see! </p>
