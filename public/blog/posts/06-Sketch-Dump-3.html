          Hello, everyone! It's December!!!<br>
        Do you like December and all the Christmas music and decorations?!<br> 
        I'm mostly indifferent to all of it. Christmas itself doesn't excite me that much. It's like... a day. <br>
        I like the red, though. Red is a good colour!
      </p>
        <p>
          One thing I have to say is: The weather is terrible here where I live and it's freaking cold in my house. 
        I have like 15° celsius in my studio if I'm lucky. <br>
        My hand are always freezing and drawing is difficult. I have to spend at least 10 minutes trying to warm my hands... sigh.<br> 
        On the good side: I've been sleeping a lot. I love it. I love sleeping. Sleeping is the best. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Anyways! It's almost the end of the year! And what do you do at the end of the year, usually? Start a new habit, of course!<br>
        One thing that I've been doing lately is <u>drawing just before going to sleep</u>. <br>
        I usually read a book or a fanfiction on my ereader while I'm laying on my bed, 
        but I had the idea of putting a sketchbook I was not using and some brush pens 
        (Kuretake ZIG Clean Color Real Brush) that I was not using on my bedside. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I suffer from chronic neck pain so I can't draw a lot while I'm sitting on my bed because of the awkward position, 
        but I've been drawing for a little bit every night for a couple of weeks now and so far I'm loving it! <br>
        It's usually mindless stuff like drawing my cat who's sleeping beside me or drawing about movies or books I'm currently enjoying.
        </p>
        <p>
         I've never been much of a writer,
        so even if I try journaling on a daily basis I usually end up writing a few sentences and then forgetting to update it for a week. 
        (writing also strains my neck and right shoulder more than drawing)<br>
        But with this new drawing journal I can just mess around on the pages, think about my day and relax. Just like journaling, but without words.<br>
        It's nothing novel and I bet a lot of people already do that, but I'm surprised of how much it benefits me.  
        </p>
        <p>
          So yep, drawing silly doodles before sleeping? I totally recommend it.
        </p>
        <p>
        All is well all is good, but let me share my last random stuff with you! (yeah, I attempted a rhyme because I'm awesome like that)
