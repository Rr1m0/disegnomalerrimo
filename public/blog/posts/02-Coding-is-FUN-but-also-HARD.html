      <p>I'm tired _(:3 」∠)_ </p>
      <p>
        While I'm incredibly satisfied of what I'm doing with this little page 
        (especially since the last time I tried building a website it was more than 10 years ago and I never really got started in the first place), 
        I'm a little bit overwhelmed to be honest.  <br>
        I want to do so much stuff!</p>
        <p>
        Today I added 3 new pages: 2 are just dummy pages I plan to fill with information and lists (I love lists). I want to fill them immediately!!! AAAAH! <br>
        I want to work on all the "shrines" I have planned and add a lot more sketches here! I have already made a note with some topics I want to talk about in this blog, but I need time and energy to properly write them down.<br>
        I also have some art projects to prepare for. I plan to do something "elaborated" for October. But we'll see... 
      </p>
        Nonetheless, I'm very happy I have a lot of ideas for this little place. <br>
        I'm busy, tired, but content. (>ω^)
