      <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
        [[context: I recently simplified the website's entire layout and made some overdue adjustments to the gallery. This below is the reason why.]] 
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end of 2023, I decided and then promptly announced that I was going to do a 13 weeks solo challenge here, on this website. 
        The challenge was going to be <a href="/galleria/2024_TreeChallenge.html">this tree challenge</a>. 
        <br>
        Needless to say: I FAILED. But, incredibly enough, I didn't fail because I didn't draw or study any trees during that time (I did, yay!), 
        but because I absolutely had no will to share them here. I just didn't care enough to curate that page and, to tell the truth, I was feeling the pressure to update this website and "make it look good".   
      </p>

        <p>
        I sometimes look at other people's site with beautiful portfolios, full of polished art pieces that required at least a couple of hours,
         but realistically more than 5 or 10 hours, and I marvel at them: 
         the beauty, the concept, the composition, the light, the software, the watercolour, the line art! What exquisite gusto! 
        
        <p>
        And then an innocent yet very dangerous thought gains strength inside my brain, my own naïvety the doping to its neurons: 
        <br>
        <span style="font-style: italic;"> "I could do that". </span>
        </p>

        <p>    
        Not really in term of artistic ability and skills, no. 
        I am very obviously a beginner hobbyist in term of drawing skills and I am under no delusion 
        of being able to compete with people who are very serious about their craft and have been drawing and/or painting for years. 
        <br>   
        It's more the "forma mentis", the mindset, I want to imitate: how to think about the art piece or, in this specific case, the website. 
        <br>
        I want to feel like I'm doing something "important", <span style="font-style: italic;">something of value</span>, something to admire. 
        </p> 

        <p>
        And yeah, no. I'm not like that. LOL 
        ¯\_ʘᗜʘ_/¯        
        </p>

        <p> 
        I am a very chaotic person and I can't take myself nor what I do too seriously anymore. 
        I did for a long time and it always ended up badly for me, so now my default state is switched to "chaotic gremlin trying to survive having fun". 
        <br>
        I have no idea why I am the way I am, but I blame therapy. Therapy made me start drawing. Blame my therapist for this whole mess.     
        </p>

        <p>
        No, but seriously (eeeh), taking myself and this website *seriously* (ooooh)?
        <br>
        I can't. And I can't let myself bend to that self-imposed pressure.   
        </p>

        <p>
        I've had the same, and even worse, experience with blogs. 
        <br>
        I've been reading a lot of blogs written in English, since they are the most available to me at the moment, 
        and WOAH there is a lot of interesting topics to explore and people living very fascinating (yet simple) lives. 
        <br>
        I'd love to be able to express myself that clearly! 
        I want to enchant other people with my own little musings and transport them far away from their own problems or
        make them think deeply about certain issues I hold dear. 
        <br> 
        But I can't.
        </p>

        <p>
        UH yeah Rrimo, but maybe if you were to write in Italian, it'd be easier for you, no? 
        <br>
        Good point, but NAH, I don't think so.
        <br> 
        Unfortunately even writing in my native language is kind of difficult to me. 
        Expressing myself with words and more or less articulated sentences does not come easily for me. It never has. 
        </p>

        <p>       
        The problem is that deep down I believe that what I think holds no value. That everything I do has no value, that everything I think has no value. 
        That I, me, myself are void, null. <span style="font-style: italic;"> I have no value. </span>
        <br>
        It's always been like this, since I was a little kid. 
        I was silent most of the time and even while I was speaking or raising my voice and shouting in anger, I was not actually vocalizing my thoughts. 
        </p>

        <p>
        I have to say that growing up I encountered many loving people who tried to prove me wrong, 
        who truly listened to me and had an interest in what I had to say and how I felt. But deep down... 
        <br>
        Deep down that root is still there. Even if I attempt sowing and cultivating new healthier plants, 
        in that ground the remains of that tainted root is still there, slightly infecting everything that dares growing on there.  
        </p>

        <p>
        This is actually why sharing my drawings online and with other people IRL has been so revolutionary to my life: 
        because I can't communicate well with words, I can try doing that with silly sketches. And I love that!
        </p>

        <p>       
        I love my silly sketches! They are my words, my main communication tool. They are little pieces of my own ego scattered on scrap paper.  
        </p>

        <p>
        I love drawing, it makes me feel ALIVE, and I do it daily, but if I were to force myself to do it *seriously* 
        I'd probably burn myself to a crisp and never recover from that damage. 
        <br>
        I do strive to properly learn the drawing fundamentals and get better at it, but it's a mean to the end of being able to express myself better. 
        It's like aiming to high proficiency in your target language: you need proper structured bases to construct a complex sentence that is intelligible to others.  
        </p>

        <p>
        Why was I putting pressure on myself in order to make my website and gallery more "presentable", whatever it means to my brain?
        <br>
        Why? How self-destructive.    
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
        So, to wrap this all up: what did I learn from attempting and failing my tree challenge and in trying "too hard" to have a *curated* gallery on my website? 
        </p>

        <p>
        That I am meant to be chaotic, random, spontaneous. That I am here to have fun. 
        That I love sharing silly little fast sketches, drawn both from life and from immagination. 
        <br>
        That everyone is different and everyone has their own strength. 
        </p>

        <p>
        I want one of my strength to be communication. I want other people to see the real me, my inner life, 
        not a curated version of me who's always trying to talk yet is saying nothing. 
        </p>

        <p>
        And if I can only talk with very rudimental childish words, about trivial stuff, should I even care? And why should I care? 
        <br>
        I just want to be myself for myself. 
        <br>
        I don't want to care. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <span style="font-style: italic;">My art has value</span>. To me. And that's enough.
         </p>
