        <p>。.:☆:･'(⌒―⌒*))) HELLO!         
        </p>
        <p>Today I'm going to briefly talk about a theme that is very dear to me.<br> 
          In fact it's one of the 4 words I use as my small and still incomplete "site manifesto": Accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>Even if I don't really know how to code anything more complex than a box with fancy borders 
        (seriously, I have so much fun with that. It's incomprehensible even to me), 
        I'm trying to make the site compatible to mobile phone and as accessible as possible from the beginning. 
        </p>
        <p> The other day I succeeded in making the list on my map site page responsive and it was a real feat. 
        Go me! So much satisfaction!!! Take a look at <a href="/map.html">this gem</a>!  
        My small responsive html baby... (I love the tree design! I put credits in my code if you want to take a look!) 
       </p>       
        <p>Being ignorant in web design I simply set the screen size at 600 and then kept making adjustment while looking at a small Firefox tab, ahaha. 
        My code is:        
        <pre> @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) </pre> 
        </p>
        <p>
        Does that even makes sense? Like, I obviously copied it from somewhere, and it does the job, 
        but I have no idea if 600 is the correct number. <br>
        I think at one point I just... guessed... 
        I'm too tired and overwhelmed by all the stuff I have to do to think too deeply into that at the moment.
        </p>           
        <p>
        Also I have no idea why some pages do not respond as well as others to me trying to resize stuff in a smaller screen MMMH.<br> 
        whyyyy? (￣～￣;)<br>
        All questions that will have a proper answer in the future because as of now I want to start filling up some pages with writings and drawings. 
        </p>       
        <p>
        This is a good starting point to check if your site has accessibly issues: <br>
        [ <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE accessibility evaluetion tool</a> ]  <br>  
        You simply type your website's html and it will tell you what can be fixed to make it more accessible. 
        </p>
        <p>
        When I checked it I learned some stuff. Like the fact that I lack the [html lang="en-GB"] code on all my pages.<br> 
        Yeah, well, my English is not that good to begin with and maybe it can't even be called "English", but HEY maybe it's better if I put that tag in there. <br>
        They also told me that, in my gallery page, the ALT text is redundant because it's the same as the img title. I honestly tried... but I'm not very good at describing things.  
      </p>
        <p>
        I also wrote almost all my pages going from h1 straight to h3 because 
        I thought it was simply a matter of faster styling, ahah DAMN. <br>
        I started writing my pages when all I knew was img scr and a href tags lol BUT NOW I KNOW! 
        And I'm only just starting working on my website, so better fixing it now than when I have more pages. <br> 
        <br>
        It will take some times to fix it, but it will be done! (★≧▽^))★☆

           = a script that stop gifs' animation! I'm trying to implement this on a page, but I'm having some problems with the GIFS becoming enormous.<br> 
           Will work on that later and make it work before I post any GIFS <i>for my own sanity</i></li>
