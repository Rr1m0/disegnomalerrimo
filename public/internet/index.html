       This is a very personal point of view and reflection on how I waste my time online.
      </p>
      </p>
        I've been regularly surfing the internet by myself since 2001 and a lot of things has changed during these two last decades. 
        The internet has changed, but I myself have changed, too.<br>
        I love the internet. I wouldn't be the same person I am today without its influence, for better or worse.
        I love the internet of the past, but I also love the internet of now, even if it's drammatically different.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe it's valuable to take a critical look at how we personally interact with the internet and how we want it to influence our life moving forward, 
        so I decided to write a list on the major sites I regularly check these days or have checked in the past.<br> 
        This is more of a rambling than anything else. <br>
        Please don't take anything I say here too seriously. I'm mostly just talking to myself. 
      </p>
      <p>       
        To make things easier to navigate, I made the whole list collapsable.<br>
        This is a living document: I update it when I feel like adding or editing something.       
      </p>
        <p>
        Below the list I wrote <a href="#whypersonalsite" style="font-size: 1.1em;" class="linkcontent">my personal reasons</a> 
        for building and maintaining this website.
        They reside here as a reminder and a guide to myself.

        <summary>reddit</summary>
        <p>
          I have a confession to make: I am... a Redditor! *LE GASP* 
          </p>
          <p>
          It shouldn't come as a surprise, since my website is called after the nickname I have set up for the reddit account I used for r/SketchDaily. <br>
          The truth is... u/disegnomalerrimo is me, mom... I'm so ashamed of myself. <br>
          Still, if someone were to check that account 
          (you can, but it's basically awful quick sketches or sketches already showcased in this site's gallery. not worth wasting your time over) 
          they'd find out that it was born on June 1st, when I first discovered that same sub. So they'd think I was pretty new and fresh to Reddit. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Wrooong! It's because I've had various reddit accounts during the years! 
          The beauty of reddit is how easy is creating throwaway accounts and staying more or less anonymous. 
          I think I've had 6 or 7 different accounts in the span of 8 years. 
          </p>
          <p>
          I've been on and off of reddit since 2012. but I made my first account in 2015, 
          when I joined a sub dedicated to a gatcha game I was playing at the time (NOZOMI!!!). <br>
          I was never an overly active user. I mainly just lurked around and commented on some minor subreddits about my various hobbies or 
          on support focused subs about specific problems I had. <br>
          Back then I treated reddit as a forum platform. I'd bookmark a subreddit and visit only that. 
          I don't think I even knew what r/all and r/popular even were back then. How naive I was! 
          </p>
          <p>
          The problems for me started with the pandemic. <br>
          I made the awful mistake of downloading a 3rd party app (I think it was something like redreader??? who knows) 
          to access reddit from my smartphone and OH BOY. I was not ready for that. <br>
          It has to be said that it was in the middle of the pandemic and I was in a very difficult living situation all around, 
          but UHM the more I had access to reddit the more anxious and irritable I became. 
          I had a similar experience with twitter when I briefly had the app on my phone in 2016 (Twitter on my phone lasted one week. 
          I deleted the app and never re-installed it). My main problem is that I LOVE READING. About anything, really. 
          I can spend 10 hours a day reading and never get tired of it. 
          And then I can fool myself into thinking that, since I've spent all day reading and not playing video games or watching youtube videos, 
          it was all a very productive use of my time, right??? 
          </p>
          <p>
          Who doesn't love information? Who doesn't love thinking that you're improving your life just because 
          you're subbed to 10 different self-discipline subreddits that hold very valuable information? 
          </p>
          <p>
          I think I wasted MONTHS starting my day reading reddit. All that time wasted on AskReddit or GetDisciplined... omg... the regrets. <br>
          Then in 2021 I tried limiting it for an hour maximum a day and then only on the weekends (using my best friend leechblock), 
          but then I continued to fell into stupid rabbit holes and wasting my entire afternoon reading some posts about doomer news or controversies.<br>
          I did learn a lot through scavenging subreddits, but it's largely all useless information to my day to day existence.  
          </p>
          <p>
          Then it all changed in mid 2023, with all the API and 3rd party app reddit fiasco and blackout. <br>
          A blessing in disguise, really. I stopped using reddit entirely for a couple of days 
          (YEAH, even a couple of days were hard for me back then) 
          and then when I started using it it was only briefly and only to post the daily sketches. 
          </p>
          <p>
          I started the daily sketch challenge on June 1st and I was right at its beginning when the blackout happened, so
          I told myself "I'm still continuing with the daily sketches, 
          but I'm banning all the other subs and not loggingin my main account for a month".
          I did than and then I've never looked back and my main account is still gathering dust. 
          I haven't touched it since June. I should delete it, but honestly I'm a little bit scared that if I were to log back in I would just repeat the circle of reddit addiction all over again. 
          </p>
          <p>
          I still have my u/disegnomalerrimo's account, but I've recently been inactive even of that. 
          I had to cut my participation for a while because I was getting sucked by reddit once again, but I really miss that place. 
          For me it's a very stimulating and motivating community, so overall a positive social media space that's worth preserving in my digital life.  
          </p>
          <p>
          I think I will try posting there again soon and continue participating on a more controlled scheduled basis. 
          I will try posting only for a consecutive week each month or only on the weekend, so I can understand what the most sustainable model is for me. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Reddit is not all rotten and there are some very useful and positive subs around there, but since I stopped using it daily my life has improved significantly. <br>
          Yeah, it seems stupid and trivial, especially now that everybody know that social media are bad, but it's the truth. I feel it! 
          </p>
          <p>
          Right now in November 2023, I'm still not 100% reddit free. I sometimes use it for technical info and when I'm particularly down 
          I still circle around the doomer or the self-discipline subs,
          but it's more controlled and restricted now. The cravings are still there, sure, but they are going pretty silent lately. 
          We will see how long it lasts. 
          <br>[EDIT: February 2024: Getting better by the day. The only sub I occasionally lurk now is r/nosurf, 
          but I think I'm almost ready to cut out even that "support" channel. 
          Still not back on r/SketchDaily and I miss that place. Not ready to go back, though. SIGH]
          </p>
          <p>
          So yeah, these were the confession of a (mostly formerly) addicted redditor. I hope you enjoyed reading this!<br>
          I still have a lot of problems I need to deal with. <br>
          Reddit is not the problem itself, but it's how I've managed to escape and ignore my problems for a long time. 
          </p>
          <p>
          I hope writing this and thrusting it into the www will help me. And maybe whoever is reading this, even just a tiny little bit.

        <summary>twitter</summary>
        <p>
          September 2009. That's when my twitter account was born. It's a teenager. 
          </p>
          <p>
          My history with twitter is a little bit complicated to explain, because it's very long and maybe a little bit out of the ordinary. 
          </p>
          <p>
          When people think about twitter in 2023 they usually think about nazis, political hot takes or people tweeting from their toilet bowls about the last drama.<br>
          That was not my experience. I've almost never seen controversies, racism and nazi-fascists on that platform. 
          If I wanted to find them I had to actively search for them. There were some instances when it bled into my timeline, 
          but I was, and still am, very good at curating my feed so it almost never was a problem for me. This until very recently, anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
          But let's start from the beginning: I've started my account only because it was a free online service to message your friends. That's it. <br>
          In 2009 smartphones were not really a think in my life (I don't recall if many people had them) so you either sent paid SMS or had chat sessions. 
          Was MSN still a think back then? <br>
          I remember I had pidgin on linux, but almost nobody to chat with. 
          My friends were not very technically savvy people.  
          </p>
          <p>
          So yeah, twitter for me was mostly synonymous of free SMS until 2015,
           when I acquired my first smartphone and I finally created a WhatsApp account 
           (Yeah, I know, but that's what we used and still use in Italy to communicate). 
           My account was set on private pretty much from the very start. It was mostly used to set up meetings with other people 
           and/or share what new cool movies or TV shows we were following at the moment. It was like a small communal chat. 
           I have a lot of fond memories of those first years.
          </p>
          <p>
          My following list at first included only my friends, a couple of musicians, one or two actors and a long list of language learning resources, 
          mainly bots with daily tweets about words or grammar rules.
          </p>
          <p> 
          Then with the years I added Japanese fan-artists and original artists to my following list. <br>
          A LOT of Japanese Artists. Japanese fan-artists are either on pixiv or twitter, but on twitter they move way faster and post a lot more. It's my drug. <br>
          I have 10 different private lists divided for fandom or artistic niche (I have 3 lists for artists who only do original non derivative pieces). 
          It's why my [artist list] on the art resources page features mainly people from twitter. It's where I've discovered them and still follow them to this day. 
          </p>
          <p>
          For me the only right way to browse twitter was to create lists, show them in different columns on tweetdeck and then filter and hid the "text only" tweets. 
          My reasoning was that I was interested in the visual arts they were sharing, not their words. If I was particularly curious about a piece I would then open that specific profile and read more.<br>
          I had text only tweets visible just for my friends. <br>
          I did this for YEARS and was always slightly confused when people lamented that they see nazi roaming around their timeline 
          (now I kind of get it, but I also don't 100%). 
          </p>
          <p>
          Like, what the hell were you people doing, browsing vanilla twitter or, worse yet, the twitter app on mobile??? Insanity and masochism.
          </p>
          <p>
          Unfortunately, Elonzo Muschione (copyrighted name, of course all right reserved to Hell) paywalled tweetdeck on August 2023. <br>
          On the bright side, the time I spend on that site plummeted with that silly decision, so I'm even more twitter free than ever! 
          Thank you, Mr. Evil Wannabe Overlord. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Since I hate browsing vanilla twitter with a passion and ELONZO WILL NEVER WIN THE BATTLE FOR MY ATTENTION, 
          now I set up leechblock to redirect [twitter.com] to [twitter.com/myusername/lists]
          and from there I just open up what I want to see in that specific moment. 
          </p>
          <p>
          With my current setup I never see the "for you" or "following" pages. Only the lists I want in chronological order. 
          No suggestions or random inflammatory topic (if not retweeted from someone on my lists). 
          I usually check my friend's tweets every few days and then spend 20 minutes maximum on Sunday going through the artists I follow and liking/retweeting stuff. 
          Pretty good and sustainable for me. I'm still exposed to the art I like and admire without compromising my sanity. ...for the most part.
          </p>
          <p>
          The bad part is that without tweetdeck I can't filter out text only tweets so sometimes I'm exposed to stuff I don't want to see. 
          But eh, it could be worse. <br>
          I just try to spend more time reading Japanese tweets. They're usually pretty cute and wholesome. 
          Just people going on an on about the characters they're stanning.
          Just how it should be. The natural order...  
          </p>
          <p>
          Closing thoughts of this uselessly long rambling: <br>
          between all the en-shittification that's going forward these last few years, Twitter is the one that hurst the most. 
          Probably because of how I started using it, or the fact that I met some good people that even became my IRL friends, 
          or the creative freedom you can still find there... I don't know. It just sucks looking at it burning down from the inside. 
          Even if I hate Elonzo Muschione and what he represents, I still can't really cheer at Twitter's death. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Best twitter memories: huge tweet chains with my friends, meeting a couple of very good people, November 5th 2020
          </p>
          <p>
          NOTE: My twitter account will never be closed by me. It will be there until the entire website finally collapses. 
          They'll have to kill it with fire, them cowards! I will probably cry a little when it happens.

            I have a personal account (private), but I never log in. I believe the last time I checked it, it was back in 2021.<br>
            I created that account in 2017 because I enrolled in a course where a lot of people used that app as a messaging platform. 
            I shared 3 photos in total then completely lost interest. I occasionally checked my DMs, but nothing more.<br>
            I think I had the app on my phone for just a couple of days. 
            I had a slow and clucky phone back then and I really disliked how busy the design felt, even before stories 
            (reels?) were a thing. When they began implementing them my interest plummeted even more. 
            I really don't like the short video format...
          </p>
          <p>
            I have friends that occasionally share stories/posts with me and I really appreciate that. <br>
            They know that I don't use the platform so they share what they think I'd enjoy knowing/seeing and I love them for thinking about me.
          </p>
          <p>
            ADDENDUM: In February 2024 I surface searched the iteration of my nickname "Rrim0" on DDG and discovered there is someone on instagram with that name! Great choice, buddy. Good for you. And great photos.

              Oh, Neocities! The web hosting service this little website is currently residing on. <br>
              Neocities is a strange beast... On one hand I love it. On another I don't really get it, aha. 
              I guess it's because I'm old (yeah, I'm going to use it as a justification, I CAN!!!).
            </p>  
            <p>
              Neocities provides certain features like "following" other profiles/sites, "commenting" and "liking" what other people say in their own profile, 
              on other people's profile or simply any given update. <br>
              My site has the "profile" option disable since pretty much the beginning, as soon as I discovered you could turn it off it was gonw. 
              Even now, you can't comment on and follow me on Neocities. <br> 
              It's kind of difficult explaining why I made that decision, but I will try:  
            </p>              
            <p>
              This page is not really conceptualized as a portal to have interaction with other people, 
              so I don't get why it should have comments open to everyone ALL THE TIME.<br>
              Sure, there are some information about me and my hobbies. This site's a mean to communicate to the www who I am as a person, 
              but it's first and foremost a repository for my progress (ahaha) in drawing, coding and various resources. <br>
              I'm not against having interactions with other people here (I do have my e-mail address written in my [about] page
              if you want to chat with me!), 
              but I'd like to have more control from my part and I find the default Neocities profile settings lacking on that department. 
            </p>              
            <p>
              I also find it all too overwhelming. 
              Followers... why would I need followers, especially for a website that's still a constant work in progress? <br>
              Sometimes I update this website to change just a tiny typo and nothing else. 
              The thought that someone could receive the notification of that update and maybe check and see nothing has changed truly disturbs me and gives me anxiety. 
              It surely shouldn't... BUT IT DOES. 
            </p>
            <p>
              NOTE: My main exposure to personal websites until now has been either blogs or Japanese fansites.<br>
              On blogs you usually comment under the post itself and share relevant (or not) opinions and thoughts about what has been discussed. <br>
              On Japanese sites the norm is usually utter silence from the "audience". 
              Maybe you can send a "clap" (= a general "LIKE" feature for the whole page), 
              an anonymous message or a private e-mail, but there is no open guestbook or chat-box.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              I guess that's one of the reasons why I'm so confused by these Neocities' interactive elements.
              It's an hybrid between social media and a hosting service and it's something I'm not used to. <br>
              I don't really "dislike" (ehe) it, but I just don't get the point of those features. 
            </p>             
            <p>
              So yeah. No profile here. I don't want followers or likes and other stuff like that. 
              I've never had those even on other major social media platforms and I'm certainly not starting now with a personal website. :/ <br>
              Maybe my feelings will change in the future as I get more confortable having a public presence online, but I seriously doubt that. 
              You never know, though. Never say never. <br>

        <p>
            When I get into a new manga or anime it's the first site I check.  <br>
            I'm obsessed with reading all the little comics, 4koma and whatnot, that people post over there.  
          </p>          
          <p>
            If a fandom is fairly active or large I sometimes end up opening more than 100 tabs that will take me days to see all. 
            I justify wasting my time there because I read fanfiction too and they are pretty good Japanese exercise. 
          </p>          
          <p>
            I also used it a lot as a resource to prepare for cons when I could participate. 
            Now I wistfully stare at the list of doujinshi released for new events I can't attend to and cry silently because I can't buy them... 
            I STILL SAVE THE SAMPLE PAGES, THOUGH! YOU NEVER KNOW!!!
          </p>         
          <p>
            Pixiv is not a perfect platform by any means, but, at the end of the day, it's either pixiv or twitter to follow Japanese fan-artists nowadays.
            And I have to say, between the two of them: pixiv >>> twitter.
          </p>          
          <p>
            NOTE: I'm forever grateful to pixiv for making Japanese artists more available online. 
            Do you fellow old people remember when Japanese personal sites blocked IPs from overseas? Because I do...  <br>
            That's how I learned of the existence of proxy and VPNs! <br>
            So yeah, Thanks pixiv!
          </p>         
          <p>
            BONUS: Good people of the western internet, remember to NOT COMMENT to Japanese people on pixiv in English. Please.  <br>
            Commenting culture is not huge over there and there are some artists that still get scared when they see foreigners in their fandoms. 
            (The same applies to twitter. Some people appreciate the comments over there, but that's still not the norm)

          1. Got my first account in 2008, deleted it in 2010 circa because of reasons. 
          I had that "pet society" game on that account. Only thing I remember, honestly. 
          </p>
          <p>
          2. Opened my second account in 2011 because I needed to use it for something related to my studies > 
          almost never logged in and completely forgotten about it > finally deleted in 2018
          </p>
          <p>
          3. Tried to open a third account in 2019 because my job required it for a "community building" project, 
          but it got rejected by the moderation team (probably because I used my work e-mail address to register).

              Hey, I got one of those! <br>
              My account is more than 10 years old, ahahahaaaaa... orz 
            </p>         
            <p>
              I've never ever written an original post, lol. I just reblogged gif sets or the occasional meme or meta post about that particular show I was into. <br>
              Like almost everyone on this planet Earth, I abandoned that site for a while during those ehm, difficult years. 
              I completely erased it from my mind from like 2013 to 2016. I'm not even exaggerating.... <br>
              I then returned to it, but I curated my feed in a meticulous manner. A lot of blocking was involved. A LOT. 
            </p>         
            <p>
              I don't log much nowadays because my firefox configuration hates that site and I can't log through it. I have to log in through chrome and UGH no, thanks.  <br>
              I think I log in once every three months to check some tags and hunt for some fanarts, but I always become frustrated very fast.  <br>
              Like, DAMN, that site sucks, lol. You can't really find anything and it doesn't stop becoming worse. Plus, my internet provider hates it (it always did, that site is heavy as hell) 
              so it's slow and most of the time it doesn't even load all the images properly. It's a pretty miserable experience all around. 
            </p>         
            <p>
              But yeah, even if I don't go much in there, I still know about a bunch of Tumblr only phenomenon. 
              I honestly can't even explain why, but I do. It's in my DNA. 
            </p>          
            <p>
              Best Tumblr memories: Goncharov, Reigen and Sans killing the Queen, all the Supernatural and JoJo meme.  
            </p>         
            <p>
              Like with twitter, my account will remain online until tumblr finally meets its demise. I wonder who will die first.

              AHAHA, NOPE. I'm not interested in the slightest at the moment. <br>
              Every time someone tries to hype up a “<em>twitter alternative</em>” I roll my eyes because for me the real problem is not that twitter itself is a shit hole (which, it is and always have been), 
              but that I completely lost interest in the twitter model itself. <br>
              I'm at that life stage where I don't care about other people's life updates or twitter style “hot takes”. I'm over it all.
            </p>
            <p>
              I still check twitter only because of the artists I follow and my small group of friends still active on there. <br>
              As long as they remain on twitter I have no real reason to make an account on any other “twitter alternative”.
            </p>
            <p>
              I do however follow a couple of mastodon channel I bookmarked. <br>
              As of February 2024 there is not much that interests me, though.

            I'm <span style="text-decoration: underline">OLD</span>. 
            Why whould I have a <span style="font-style: italic;"> tick tock? </span> *channeling my inner boomer*<br>
            No, but seriously, I'm always been very wary of tiktok since the earliest alligations that it was "spyware from china omg!". 
            Don't really care if it's actually true. I just never installed it and never got the appeal of it to begin with. 
          </p>            
          <p>
            As I said already I really don't like the short video format. I also hate that it continues to repeat the videos. STOP!!!
            WHY DON'T YOU STOP PLAYING FOR A SECOND??? OMG!!!
            And what is up with all those videos of people dancing with written stuff going around?! 
            YO, GIVE ME AN ARTICLE TO READ INSTEAD??? /shaking my grandpa fist against them damn youngsters
          </p>            
          <p>
            I have some friends that send me some tiktoks and so I sometimes watch just the ones they send me. 
            But I'm pretty much ignorant and don't care that much about it and its culture. <br>
            You do you, young people. 
          </p>
          <p>
            (I'm aware that tiktok is used by people of all ages. A lot of my 30+ years old friends use it!
             But my brain is just too slow to process those fast paced videos. I feel like a 1500 years old decrepit mummy)

        <summary>forums</summary>         
          <p>
            I was a big forum user in my youth, especially from 2005 to 2008. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            You could find me on various Italian forums about anime and manga. (the ones hosted on forumfree.net I RICORDI MAMMAMMMIA)
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I do believe that my internet time back there was 80% writing posts on forums and 20% fanfiction/game-mods hunting. 
            I acquired an ADSL modem [[ finally unlimited internet access at home! still, 
            we had only ONE modem and three personal computers in the family, 
            so we had to "battle" each other to gain internet access and my mother had absolute priority ]] in 2006 I think, 
            so I spent some time almost every day catching up with *my people*. (around 2007 (?) I stared going on LJ, too) <br>
            I was even a mod for a very small RP forum! But if I recall correctly everyone participating was a mod, aha, 
            so that doesn't really count. We were like 5 people in a closed space doing RP of different characters. 
            We were not particularly good at it and I was possibly the worst player, uh. 
            I've never been good at role-playing, unfortunately, but it was so much fun!
          </p>
          <p>
            Incredibly enough some of those forums I frequented are still up and you can still read those old threads. 
            I walked down that memory lane in mid-2023 and my throat became chocked up because DAMN we really were having a blast. 
            I miss those places. <br>
            I was a radically different person back then. 
            I was not doing better nor was I in an healthier mental space and I much prefer who I am and where I am as a person now, 
            but I can see that I was having the time of my life posting stupid shit with internet strangers and 
            simply being a kid gushing out about anime and simping about my favourite characters. <br>
            It truly was awesome.  
          </p>    
          <p>
            I stopped actively participating in those forums in 2008-2009 because of IRL commitments and an overall change of interests and focus. 
            Some of those people with whom I messed around in those animanga communities 
            (a lot of them I actually met even IRL. Italy is a small place, after all...) became my mutuals on other social media platforms. <br>
            I still follow some of them on Twitter, but we don't really "talk" anymore. A shame, really. 
            It's probably also my fault because I'm abysmal at keeping online relationships alive. (I'm sorry)
          </p>
          <p>
            ANYWAY! AFTER THAT: 
          </p>
          <p>
            I then continued to keep tabs on certain forums regarding my various hobbies and interests. 
            Sometimes it was about Nintendo hacking (esp. GBAtemp), sometimes PSP homebrews or other hack mods. 
            Sometime about Linux, Raspberry-Pi or language learnings... I had a lot of account in different forums throughout the 2010s to this day.  <br>
            But my participation was exclusively on the "I need a problem solved, here is my question" or "I have a solution to your problem, 
            here it is" side of thing. I never tried to actively engage in community building. 
            <br>
            [ADDENDUM: Oh, I think this is why reddit is the social media I've used the most in recent years. It's a hop in-out forum galore. 
            I basically have the same "answer specific question and then vanish into the night" pattern I've always adopted in these forums, lol]
          </p>         
          <p>
            Forums still exists and are still thriving. 
            They actually never stopped being a huge part of internet culture (and yeah, people that said that forums died during Web 2.0... They wrong.) 
            and to me they are the most interesting internet hubs. <br>
            Unfortunately I think I am personally over "trying to fit" into a forum. 
            While a lot of people find them "slow", especially if they compare them to other social media platforms, I still find them too overwhelming. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I tried to push myself out of my comfort zone when in mid-2023 I encountered a forum about web-crafting and retro-culture, 
            but after a couple of months and an handful of contributions I just... noped out. <br>
            Too many people, too many unrelated topics, I have no idea how to interact, 
            I don't think that what I'm writing is adding anything to the conversation, etc. 
            I don't like how that makes me feel. I'm not exactly "anxious"... I'm more like "whatever". <br>
            And I don't think that's actually a positive attitude to bring to a social platform. 
            or at least, I <b>personally</b> don't want to be THAT person. 
            I don't like it when I become the person who says "whatever" and throws up their hands in the sky. <br>
            I am someone who cares fiercely about certain topics and I feel like trying to express myself in public online spaces 
            (especially English speaking ones, due to my proficiency limitation) forces me to trivialize my knowledge and feelings. <br>
            I'm maybe overthinking this, but it doesn't make me feel... <i>right</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I just always feel out of place and not in line with my principles. <br>
            <span style="font-size: 0.9rem">  (I'm still glad I did try, though. 
              It was a good experience! And the people over that forum are very kind and interesting.) </span>
          </p> 
          <p>
            I think that MAAAAAYBE if it was a forum of IDK maybe maximum 20 people I could maybe try participating in it and try "making friends"... 
            But honestly it's still an effort and commitment I'm not sure I'm ready to make at the moment. If ever. 
          </p> 
          <p>
            I'm possibly too old for it and surely I'm just too tired now. lol. Dealing with people IRL is HARD, 
            but dealing with people on the internet is even harder for me. I like having 1 on 1 conversations (like through e-mails), 
            especially if they have the potential of developing into deep long exchanges, but public conversations are "too big", "too dispersive" for me. 
          </p> 
          <p>
            I will still hop through my various forums, lurk and make the occasional post, 
            but I think that my "forum era" is completely closed off. At least for now. 
          </p> 
          <p>
          And I'm not sure I like it for me. :(

          UUUH nothing much to say about this, actually. 
          </p>
          <p>
          It always weirds me out when I see stuff like "JOIN THE COMMUNITY DISCORD" 
          because isn't Discord a voice chat app for playing games with your friends???
          <br>
          What even are discord communities? lol 
          </p>
          <p>
          NAH, to tell the truth: I tried to join a community back in 2017. It was heavily moderated and quite a nice place, actually, 
          but it really was not an overall pleasant experience for me. <br>
          A lot of people were chatting about their daily lives almost constantly and I'm sorry. I don't care? And who are you again??? 
          <br>
          I'm here to have information about a certain topic, not to know what you ate this morning or about your adorable adorable dog 
          (right click > save image of cute dog).
          </p>
          <p>
          I also find it extremely difficult to participate (see "forums" voice, but with chats is waaay worse for me) 
          and the underlying expectation that you'll be online most of the time and be on par with all new information is sincerely baffling and anxiety inducing to me. 
          <br>
          Let me breatheeeeeee... 
          </p>
          <p>
          I guess I think of my discord handle as my <i>private</i> chat handle that I give only to people I already know 
          (IRL or old online friends). For me it's just like a new and improved version of MSN or Skype.
          <br>
          I use it mostly to catch up with my old friends and to occasionally play with them online.  
          </p>
          <p>
          DUDE. I GUESS I'M OLD??? 
          <br>
          But we had IRC when I was younger and god, those were annoying even back then. 
          IDK maybe I'm just very asocial online.

          As a personal rule I try to buy locally everything I can, even if it's sometimes more expensive. 
          </p>
          <p>
          However, I live in a smallish town at the moment, so I now have to buy most of my art supplies from online retailers :(

          Luckily I found a shop located in Milano, Italy, that's operated by Italian people (it's momarte.com if you're interested).
          The prices are reasonable and the shipping service incredibly efficient, so I always buy what I can from them, 
          BUT they unfortunately don't have everything I need. 
          <br>
          Last year I had to buy fountain pens, inks and a couple of books from Amazon ;__; buuuuh. 
          I found some good retailers on eBay, too, but the shipping price is like... too much... ugh.   
          </p>
          <p>
          Aside from art supplies and the occasional book, I'm not buying anything else lately, so eh. It could be worse. 
          I try to limit at buying stuff for very special occasion, so usually I make a big order thrice a year maximum. 
          </p>
          <p>
          My dad had a brief stint of buying plastic crap from Temu and it was quite hilarious. 
          We actually fought about that and now he seems to have stopped. 
          Good dad listening to me.

          - <b>Netflix</b>: 
            </p>
            <p>
            I got a Netflix account as soon as they became available in Italy back in 2015. It was used as a family account (2 simultaneous screens), 
            but I was the one (willingly and enthusiastically) paying the bills. <br>
            I loved the idea that we could all use and share the service, my sisters from their TVs, my dad from his laptop and me from my PC. 
            It was awesome and revolutionary! 
            </p>
            <p>
            I continued to pay for everyone even when I was living in Japan and not really watching Netflix for months due to me being extremely busy. 
            I loved the idea that my family could entertain themselves however they wanted and we could even watch the same shows 
            almost simultaneously and then have a little chat about those. It was fun!  
            </p>
            <p>
            Thanks to my family I discovered Breaking Bad, Dark, the Umbrella Academy and How to Get Away with Murder, 
            all series that I ended up enjoying a lot.<br>
            And it was stuff that they discovered thanks to Netflix and I watched there! WOW!
            </p>
            <p>
            Unfortunately the en-shittification tarnished Netflix a lot during recent years, and the service and the content become worse and worse. 
            I do believe that in Italy and Japan, the two countries where I personally used it, the catalogues were and are still not that bad. 
            But the new stuff are not that good overall. :/<br>
            Sometimes you still have something decent, but IMHO the price is now too high for the time I'm spending watching 
            and the quality of the catalogue overall. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I finally unsubbed at the start of 2024. My plan was initially doing so last year when they began blocking password sharing, 
            but due to my family still watching it I had to wait for everyone to be done. 
            </p>

            Now I'm free.

            - <b>Spotify</b>: 
            </p>
            <p>
            I was a premium subscriber for MMMMH one year and an half, maybe? from 2021 to mid 2022. I'm not sure though, could be two years. <br>
            Spotify is a good service and I have almost no complaints 
            (apart from the ethics of their treatment to artists and the fact that they continuously try to sell you podcasts and 
            I LOATH PODCASTS LEAVE ME ALONE WILL YOU!). 
            I discovered a lot of new music and the fact that they sync the lyrics helped me A LOT with my Russian practice. <br>
            BUT eh, I don't like having that app on my smartphone. 
            I find it distracting and it leads me to use my smartphone more than I'd like.  
            </p> 
            <p>
            Conclusion:<br> I am now using Spotify (non-premium) exclusively while I'm on my PC. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I try not to listen to much music on the go because my tinnitus is getting worse (SOB) and while it's mostly a neurological problem in my case, 
            blasting loud music through my headphones surely didn't help... I have some regrets.  <br>
            When I do listen to music while outside 
            (because I'll be damned if I have to listen to other people while they're talking about private stuff on public transport), 
            I now usually listen to stuff I've previously download on my phone or I go to newpipe and search for those album long compilation that are on youtube. 
          </p>
              <p>--------------</p>
          <p>
            - <b>Amazon Prime</b>: 
            </p>
            <p> 
            Damn, Amazon Prime's interface is bad. LIKE. AWFUL. 
            </p>
            <p> 
            I'm using my sister's husband's account (*devil emoji*) since I refuse to give my money to Mr. Amazon if I can avoid doing so. 
            <br>
            If they start putting ads or blocking my access I wouldn't lose much. <br>
            Whatever. I already watched all the decent horror movies (and even most of the terrible ones) 
            and every passing day more and more content is pay-walled under other subscriptions - 
            seriously, there are like 4 additional channels to subscribe to through Prime. 
            </p>
            <p> 
            And what is up with the subtitles?! I swear to god they ripped the subs from an external source and sometimes they are so wrong it's hilarious. 
            I watch almost everything with subs and it is very noticeable. Utter disappointment. 
            </p>     
                <p>--------------</p>
            <p>
              Overall these are my feelings regarding the subscription model: 
              <br> 
              I'm ecstatic in the beginning because the service is most of the time excellent. 
              I get reeeeally into the content I'm being sold and consume what I can with no pressure at my own pace. 
              GOOD TIME! Very happy!
              </p>
              <p> 
              BUT THEN: my feelings become very conflicted. 
              <br>
              I feel like if I don't consume the content I'm paying for I'm wasting money, 
              so I actually force myself to use the streaming service even though I actually want to use my time differently and 
              thus I end up watching stuff I'm not even interest into. <br>
              WHAT IS MY PROBLEM??? 
              </p>
              <p> 
              At the end of the day I'm way happier with no media streaming service. 
              I feel no pressure to "consume" media, especially new TV shows, and I can just enjoy my occasional horror movies marathon in peace.<br> 
              In the end I discovered I just care about horror movies/TV shows. 
              It's amazing how much I'm like "whatever" with almost every other type of movie (apart from musicals I LOVE THEM!!!). 
              For introspective dramatic stuff I much prefer reading a book. For action I prefer playing a videogame or reading an action manga.<br>
              So why should I pay for a streaming services for "every type of media" while I'm just interested in my small niche?  
              </p>
              <p> 
              If I lived in North-America I'd probably be the most loyal Shudder (streaming service only for horror content) subscriber... but who knows. 
              </p>
              <p> 
              The only subscription I'm gladly paying as of February 2024 is for thevirtualinstructor, 
              an art tutorial website from Matt Fussell. I just like the guy. And I pay yearly with a discount so it's around 5 euros a month. Not bad!
              </p>
              <p> 
              OH YEAH, and my subscription to proton VPN. That's it.

       <span class="whybig">1. because <b>I WANT TO</b> :</span> <br>
        Nobody is forcing me. I began building this site because I wanted to.<br>
        This site will continue to grow and update as long as I feel like it.
        I'm here only because I want to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="whybig">2. because <b>I CAN</b> :</span> <br>
        Nobody is preventing me from building this site from scratch. <br>I can do whatever I want with it.<br>
        Neocities is a good place to start with since you don't have to invest any more than your time and passion. 
        I can experiment and see if I enjoy having a personal site.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="whybig">3. to <b>LEARN</b> :</span> <br>
        Building something from scratch is a good way to learn something new.<br>
        I've always been interested in learning HTML/CSS, but I never had any real incentive before.
        Now that I have a website and I need to write code by myself I already learned a lot in the span of a few weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="whybig">4. because it's <b>FUN</b> :</span><br>
        It's nice to create something and have a personal little space in the web.<br>
        I can show it to my friends if I want to and generally have fun sharing the stuff I draw. 
        I enjoy listing the various art resources I use and sharing links to interesting sites and videos.<br>
        It's fun. It's nice. I like it and I find it relaxing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="whybig">5. because <b>WHY NOT?</b> :</span> <br>
        I WANT TO + I CAN = Why not, then?<br>
        I don't think it requires any more reasons than these, really.
